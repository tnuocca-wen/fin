In the Americas-I market unit, revenue increased in Q2, led by healthcare and technology products. Americas-II market unit revenues declined due to the impact of the macroeconomic slowdown.

Talent utilization has increased, and the segmentation strategy is helping win bigger deals. The new global business line operating model is already showing benefits.

Wipro's actions are positively impacting delivery assurance and efficiency, ensuring long-term margin resilience and sustainable growth. In Europe, three large consolidation deals were closed in Q2, including a partnership with a global bank for digital transformation initiatives.

Wipro.com is becoming a regular topic in client conversations. There is a growing interest in exploring the benefits of this technology. The number of GenAI projects has doubled compared to last quarter. The technology is being adopted quickly in various sectors.

Moderator begins Q&A session, first question from Kumar Rakesh regarding large deal TCV. Wipro consistently reports 1 billion or more of large deal TCV. Revenue from existing customers close to 100%, implying most deals are renewal deals. Other companies experiencing same challenge, but have better growth outlook. Wipro's outlook suggests further deceleration despite deal win TCV. Kumar asks if large deal TCV is mostly renewals and not new deals. Thierry Delaporte disagrees, says there's a balance between new and renewals. Revenue trend reflects winning large deals that take time to convert. Less discretionary spend affecting revenue. Wipro has strong pipeline, winning more large deals every quarter. Discretionary spend is lower, particularly in consulting business. Wipro expects slow bounce back if market remains the same, guiding for the upcoming quarter.

Kumar Rakesh asked about the strategy of exiting smaller accounts, which has resulted in a decrease of about $90 million in revenue. Thierry Delaporte explained that the strategy is to focus on larger accounts and build partnership relationships for significant growth. Small accounts have higher costs and require more time to close deals. The number of large accounts over $100 million has doubled from 11 to 22. Middle accounts have performed better than smaller ones, confirming the effectiveness of the strategy. Kumar Rakesh asked about the timing of the strategy and its impact on revenue. Thierry Delaporte acknowledged that the market has changed and growth is not currently possible. The focus is on transformation, relevance, and investment priorities to maintain margins and be ready for growth when the market improves.

Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley asks about initiatives to attract mega deals worth $500 million or more and the nature of bookings. Thierry Delaporte explains that they have focused on larger deals to strengthen strategic relationships with clients. They have built a larger team, retrained account executives, and won more large deals. The pipeline shows an emphasis on cost optimization and margin productivity.

Dipesh Mehta asked about the increase in sales and marketing and why it doesn't match the number of new clients. He also asked about a line item with a 2.2 billion loss and how it will trend in the future. Aparna Iyer explained that the high sales and marketing expenses are due to accelerated amortization, and the moderation in new accounts is part of the overall strategy. She also mentioned that the loss in the line item is related to a restructuring program and should be considered one-off. Dipesh asked if the line item will recur, but Aparna didn't provide guidance and said updates will be shared in the next quarter. Abhishek Kumar asked Thierry what is driving his confidence in the next couple of quarters and if the end of discretionary projects and general demand improvement are factors.

Thierry Delaporte says the guidance for Q3 includes more furloughs compared to last year. The company is cautious and expects a rebound after this quarter. Abhishek Kumar asks about the improvement in the order backlog. Delaporte explains that larger deals with strategic focus are driving the improvement. There is a greater attention to cost rationalization and consolidation of providers. Girish Pai asks Delaporte about the mood of clients. Delaporte says clients are mature about technology and curious about AI. They are cautious due to instability and anxiety but aware that they need to resume investments soon.

Girish Pai asked about the extent of Generative AI usage and future plans. Subha Tatavarti, the CTO, explained that they have been aggressively adopting Generative AI in the last six months and have seen productivity gains in areas such as HR and quality assurance. Early tests and pilots have been encouraging. Sandeep Shah questioned the company's growth strategy and whether there is a gap in their offerings. He suggested introspection of their go-to-market model due to lower growth rates compared to the industry.

Thierry Delaporte explains that Wipro has its own strategy and focus, with fluctuating growth over time. The company has achieved decent growth in the past three years and is focused on both transformation and day-to-day performance. The investments made in talent, capabilities, solutions, systems, and consulting are all part of the overall progress. While striving for more growth, the company is confident about future opportunities. Sandeep Shah asks about the expected rebound in growth, but Thierry Delaporte does not provide any further guidance.

Ravi Menon asked about Wipro's win rates in the US compared to Europe. Thierry Delaporte clarified that while they don't have a 100% win rate in the US, they have been performing well. He mentioned that win rates and pipeline are improving in the US, Europe, and Asia PAC. Thierry also stated that they are improving their qualification process to reduce lost investments. In Europe, there was a decline in financial services and manufacturing, but the pipeline remains strong and the leadership team is optimistic about a rapid recovery.
