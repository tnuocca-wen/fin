Mr. Joseph George from IIFL Securities Limited for a conference introduction. Shenu Agarwal, MD and CEO, Gopal Mahadevan, Whole-Time Director and CFO, and K.M. Balaji, Deputy CFO are part of the management team. Shenu Agarwal will start with opening remarks. The domestic MHCV industry had a 3% Y-o-Y growth in Q1. The growth in the MHCV segment is muted due to pre-buying in Q4 last year.

Ashok Leyland expects growth to improve in the future, capital expenditure in the Union Budget will drive demand for MHCV vehicles, monsoon progress affects LCV industry, 8-10% growth projected for MHCV and 5-6% growth for LCV for FY '24, commodity prices moved slightly up but are expected to soften, Ashok Leyland has outperformed industry growth in Q1 and raised prices consistently, efforts to reduce costs have led to margin improvement, EV business is important for Ashok Leyland's future and Switch is developing world-class electric products, Switch Electric LCVs will be launched in the second half of the year. Ashok Leyland has launched various vehicles during the quarter.

Ashok Leyland has launched new vehicles to expand its range. They are confident that these launches will increase their market share. In Q1, their MHCV volumes grew by 7% while the industry only grew by 3%. Ashok Leyland's market share improved. Bus volumes and market share also increased. Truck volumes remained flat, but their market share improved slightly. This is the sixth consecutive quarter with a market share of 30% or more. LCV volumes grew by 3% compared to the previous year. IO sales declined by 12% due to the global economic downturn. Aftermarket sales grew by 34% over the same period last year.

In Q1, volumes under Power Solutions business doubled to 8,776 from 4,381 in the previous year. Q1 revenues were Rs. 8,189 crores, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA for Q1 was Rs. 821 crores, 10% higher than last year. PAT increased by over 7 times to Rs. 576 crores. Operating working capital is Rs. 1,522 crores. Capital expenditure for the quarter is approximately Rs. 95 crores. Net debt as of June '23 is Rs. 1,464 crores. The first question is about discounting in the CV industry and the confidence in sustaining lower discounting.

Ashok Leyland has a positive opinion on changes in the CV industry and believes everyone should invest in the new change. People in the industry want to focus on profitability and maintaining healthy practices. They plan to launch a zero-ton to 2-ton LCV, but it is too early to comment on timelines or competition. They have confidence in being an active player in this market based on their success in the 2-ton to 3.5-ton segment.

Ashok Leyland Limited is working on developing a new product. It will take a few more months before they can provide more details. The growth in the industry is currently soft, but there is no negativity seen in any segments. The company still maintains their growth guidance for the year. They aim to expand their market share to 35% and achieve a 15% margin in the next two to three years.

Ashok Leyland wants to improve its market share in the North and East regions from 25% to roughly 30% or more. They believe this could lead to an overall market share of 35%. They have a strong presence in MDV buses with a market share of 50% or more, but in ICV buses, their market share is around 15%. They are focused on improving their market share in ICV buses. They also want to achieve a double-digit EBITDA in the near term and aim for a mid-teens EBITDA in the medium to long run. Ashok Leyland has seen many orders for EVs from governments.

Ashok Leyland participated in recent tenders and is currently in discussions with STUs for contracts. They have a healthy order book to focus on executing. The gross margins have expanded by 200 basis points despite some cost push, and there is potential for improvement in operating leverage and steel correction for the remainder of the year. Comparing Q1 of last year and Q1 of this year, Leyland has made progress.

Ashok Leyland has experienced four quarters of price increases and net price realizations have increased by approximately 1.5% to 2% per quarter. They have also implemented a cost reduction program which resulted in a 10% margin in the first quarter. Going forward, they expect further improvements in price enhancements and cost reductions.

Ashok Leyland is expecting cost reduction benefits in the upcoming quarters. Steel prices are expected to be soft in the second half of the year, which will add to industry profitability. The industry is expected to grow by 10% to 12%. There is potential for margin expansion and other benefits. Hinduja Leyland Finance will merge into NXT Digital, not demerge. The merger is expected to happen between Q3 and Q4. There are no major deviations in the timelines.

Ashok Leyland has reduced inventory levels this quarter and has good inventory management. There is no excessive inventory. The Power Solutions Business had some pre-buying due to a postponed emission norm change announcement, but overall, the business is doing well.

Defense business had high growth percentages last year despite not being a good year. The defense pipeline is building up sharply with a recent order from the Army. In terms of parts sales, there has been good growth and it reflects the spreading network and market share. The company is optimistic about non-vehicle business. Regarding discounts, prices have been raised by 2% this quarter and discounting has reduced between last year and this year.

Ashok Leyland experienced a 10% to 15% increase in vehicle stake. This increase does not add to the margin. Discounting, price realization, billing, and net price realization are separate activities. On a quarterly basis, the increase is around 10% to 12% due to price raises of 1.5% to 2% over four quarters. This suggests a total increase of 10%. the industry is able to absorb the price increases and deliver slightly higher growth. Historically, strong pricing like this has not been seen in the industry for at least 15-17 years. The net price realization was better during the BS IV regime from 2017-2019. However, it should be noted that during that time period, the content cost and average truck size were lower.

In July 2023, Ashok Leyland Limited discussed the changing pricing dynamics in the industry. They highlighted that previously there was a high discounting-led environment where net pricing was collapsing, but now net pricing is increasing sharply. They questioned how the industry and customers are responding to this change. Gopal Mahadevan explained that in Q1 of FY '20, the cost of vehicles went up by around 20% to 22% due to COVID-related factors. This led to a lack of demand and pricing power in the industry. However, last year, there was a resurgence in demand and growth due to India's high-growth economy and the need for transportation. As a result, the industry grew by about 45% to 48%."

The players decided to stop discounting to acquire customers. This led to price realizations holding on. Customers should be acquired from capability, not by discounting. This will lower the industry's breakeven point. Volume can give good margins even with slightly less volume. Commodity prices coming off, operating leverage, and better pricing will lead to better profitability for the industry. The company has been posting better results and reducing costs. Their medium-term target is mid-teens EBITDA. The next question is about the AVTR range's contribution to total volumes and profitability. The speaker cannot provide an exact figure but mentions that they monitor it for heavy commercial vehicles.

The team is working to improve profitability of intermediate commercial vehicles. Higher tonnage vehicles have better margins. The AVTR range has been successful in terms of product performance, production complexity, and reduction in parts and vendors. AVTR is crucial for the company. The speaker asks a question about new orders from STUs and the proportion of electric buses to ICE buses.

There are only a few electric bus orders so far. The electric bus market is small right now but it is expected to grow. The government wants 100% of STU demand to be electric by 2030. Electrification will start with buses and then move on to smaller vehicles and niche areas. There was no discussion about the proportion of sales to STUs and private orders for Ashok Leyland.

Ashok Leyland has become the top bus provider in India this quarter. They are expanding their product range and focusing on the bus portfolio. The bus portfolio is becoming more profitable after the impact of COVID. Schools and intercity transport are reopening, leading to increased demand for buses. The company is also starting to see margin improvement. The EV segment is just starting, but there is still high demand for diesel buses. STU (State Transport Undertaking) accounts for around 7.5% to 8% of the market and has grown by 55%. The largest segment is ICV passengers, particularly in school bus transportation. As governments start ordering more buses, the ratio of STU to private buses will change. The scrappage policy will prompt the replacement of old government vehicles and further increase private passenger transportation when intercity travel resumes.

Ashok Leyland is planning to introduce electric trucks in the market. They are currently working on different applications and focusing on niche areas. Within the next few quarters, they will conduct large-scale customer pilots to understand market requirements. They want to ensure that their technology is mature and suitable for the market before commercial launches. They are working with mature large customers who have a lot of interest in these vehicles for cost and environmental reasons. 

There has been a substantial movement in net debt from a net cash position to a net debt from March to June.

The working capital situation is the main concern. The investment in subsidiaries in the June quarter is also important. Gopal Mahadevan explains that the working capital movement is normal and has been discussed in the past. In the first quarter, working capital becomes positive due to high demand and timely collections. This leads to a negative net working capital. In April, May, and June, demand is lower, and creditors need to be paid, resulting in a positive working capital. The net cash has increased from Rs. 240 crores to Rs. 1,400 crores. There is also Rs. 1,474 crores of debt with support of Rs. 215 crores.

Ashok Leyland's working capital is the main reason for the switch. It will stabilize and plateau in the second and third quarter, then gain in the fourth quarter, resulting in better net cash generation year-on-year. Working capital has increased from two days to nine days, causing movement in the debt. The debt has increased from Rs. 243 crores to Rs. 1,400 crores due to this working capital movement. The debt situation will continue to improve. Capex for the quarter was Rs. 95 crores, and the investment in Switch was around Rs. 200 crores in temporary short-term loans.

Switch support not included in working capital days. Will support Switch for Rs. 1,200 crore this year. Switch business plan will continue. Launching new variants of LCV and bus. Rs. 1,200 crore estimate stands. EV buses mostly bought by STUs. Will consider bidding for build-operate projects. Working on penetrating private sector for EV bus sales.

Ashok Leyland is facing challenges in dealing with ecosystem challenges for their product. They are working with customers to overcome these challenges. Currently, the only model for the STU is the build-operate kind. Switch has participated in tenders and won some of them. They are in discussions with various STUs to execute those tenders. They need to think about profitability and return on capital employed (ROCE) in the long term. Gopal Mahadevan explains that they need to expand their LCV portfolio, enhance market presence in India, grow exports, and enhance defense vehicles. They also need to be relevant in future fuels like CNG and LNG.

Ashok Leyland has collaboration in hydrogen fuel cell and EVs through separate companies called Switch and OHM. OHM is not yet operationalized, but will focus on e-mobility as a service and asset-based financing. OHM will have similar operations to HLF, with the difference being operating leases for managing vehicles. The EV industry is still new, but the company wants to participate as a bus manufacturer.

Ashok Leyland Limited is creating OHM. They will serve customers as a direct sale. They are preparing for the market to say, "Why should we go to this?" Customers won't leave any money on the table. They will buy vehicles from us if they have better financing and believe they can run it more efficiently. Chirag from White Pine Investments asked about defense revenue and growth. Shenu Agarwal replied that they have developed a wide variety of products and expect good years ahead. They have discussions and tenders with the Ministry and Army.

Ashok Leyland expects a good pipeline in defense products for the next few years. They have won an order for a gun-towing vehicle and are working on advanced development for the Stallion. Historical trends show margin improvement from Q1 to Q4, and they are aiming for around 15% margins this year. In Q1, they achieved a 10% margin. This transcript has been edited for readability and is not a verbatim record.

Ashok Leyland had a 10% EBITDA in the quarter, just 1% lower than the previous quarter. The revenues were Rs. 8,100 crores, around 30% lower, but the margins didn't decrease much. The company's efforts, industry pricing, material costs, and overhead reduction contributed to this. The company aims to outperform the industry in all areas. Q4 profitability could be better than Q1. The cost increased due to emission norms migration and inflation in FY '21. The industry had benefits from COVID and other factors last year.

Last year, the industry grew by 48% in trucks, including heavy-duty trucks and LCVs, with a strong price realization benefit. However, this year we expect the industry to grow by 8% to 10% in MHCV, and price realizations will not be as high. Going forward, our focus will be on cost reductions and value engineering. Q1 has been good for Ashok Leyland in terms of market share gains and margins in MHCV and LCV. Contribution from defense, Aftermarket, and Power Solutions was also supportive in overall performance.

Ashok Leyland is satisfied with their financial results. They expect a good demand situation due to economic growth and increased infrastructure spending. They anticipate soft commodity costs and hope it will improve their margins and market share. They appreciate the interest shown in their company. The conference ends with a thank-you message.
