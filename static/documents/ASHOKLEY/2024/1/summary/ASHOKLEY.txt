The company maintains its growth guidance for MHCV and LCV. Commodity prices increased in the last quarter but are expected to decrease soon. Ashok Leyland has outperformed the industry in MHCV and LCV segments. The company is focusing on reducing costs and improving margins. The EV business is important for future growth. New products have been launched to expand the company's range. Q1 performance has shown growth in MHCV and bus volumes, flat truck volumes, and a decline in IO sales. Aftermarket sales have increased.

Chandramouli Muthiah asked about plans to launch a zero-ton to 2-ton LCV in the market and the timeframe for it. He mentioned that this market is more competitive than the 2-ton to 8-ton segment. 
Shenu Agarwal responded that they are seriously considering entering the sub-2-ton segment as it is an attractive market and they have gained confidence from their success in the 2-ton to 3.5-ton segment. However, they cannot comment on the timelines yet due to the mature and competitive nature of the market. They hope to provide more information during the year. 
Kapil Singh congratulated them on their strong results and asked about industry growth. Shenu Agarwal mentioned that there is a strong momentum and no negativity in any segments. They expected some pre-buying in the last quarter, resulting in slightly muted growth this quarter. They maintain their guidance for MHCV and LCV growth for the year.

Kapil asked about the plans to increase market share to 35% and margins to 15%. Shenu explained that they want to improve market share in the North and East regions to reach 30% or higher, which would contribute to the overall goal. They also see opportunities for growth in specific product segments. Achieving double-digit EBITDA in the near term is their focus, with a long-term goal of around 15% EBITDA. Kapil then mentioned the increased orders for electric vehicles from governments, and Ashok Leyland's active participation in this area.

Shenu Agarwal mentioned that they have a healthy order book and are focused on execution. Gunjan Prithyani asked about margin improvement and Gopal Mahadevan explained the factors contributing to gross margin expansion - steel price increases, cost reduction programs, and better net realizations.

The remaining cost for the year is focused on recent initiatives and the modular platform. The company expects benefits from cost reduction initiatives in forthcoming quarters. Steel prices are expected to soften in the second half of the year, which will contribute to profitability. There is potential for margin expansion with industry growth. Hinduja Leyland Finance will merge into NXT Digital, not demerge. The merger is expected to happen between Q3 and Q4. There are no major deviations in the timeline. The question about inventory levels in the channel was not summarized.

The transcript has been edited for clarity and is not an exact record of the meeting.
Ashok Leyland has reduced inventory levels this quarter and has good inventory management.
The company has no significant inventory with the company or dealerships.
The next question is from Pramod Kumar from UBS.
Pramod Kumar congratulates Ashok Leyland on their performance and asks about the non-vehicle side of the business.
Shenu Agarwal provides an update on the Power Solutions business and mentions the pre-buying that happened due to the postponed emission norm change.
The defense business had a high growth percentage due to a poor performance the previous year.
The defense pipeline is building up strongly and there is a significant growth expected in defense volumes for FY '24 and FY '25.
The parts business has seen good growth in the previous year and this quarter, reflecting the company's expanding network and market share.
Overall, Ashok Leyland is optimistic about the non-vehicle business.

The discounting scenario has changed in the last few quarters. Gopal Mahadevan explains that discounting has reduced between 10% to 15% in terms of vehicles. However, discounting is just one aspect of activity. Price realization, billing, and net price realization also play a role. Prices have been increased by about 1.5% to 2% on average each quarter. The industry has been able to absorb these price increases and still deliver higher growth. Historically, strong pricing like this has not been seen in the industry. In 2018-19, net price realizations were improving and margins were good. However, the current cost structure and average truck size are higher. The increasing velocity of prices adds up in the long run.

The transcript has been edited for readability and is not an exact record of the meeting. The cost of vehicles increased by 20-22% in Q1 of FY '20 due to the start of COVID. This led to a lack of demand and little pricing power in the industry. However, demand started to come back last year and the industry grew by 45-48%. Some players stopped discounting to acquire customers, leading to better price realizations. If this continues, the industry's breakeven point will decrease, resulting in better profitability. The company has been posting better results and has a medium-term target of mid-teens EBITDA. The goal is for investors to understand the company's aspirations.

Arvind Sharma from Citigroup asked about the contribution and profitability of the AVTR range of vehicles. Gopal Mahadevan mentioned that they monitor this range for heavy commercial vehicles and are working on improving the profitability of intermediate commercial vehicles. He also stated that higher tonnage vehicles have better margins. The AVTR range has been successful in terms of product performance, reduced production complexity, and benefits in terms of fewer parts and vendors. Arvind Sharma also asked about the proportion of electric buses to ICE buses in new orders from STUs.

The electric bus market is still small but expected to increase gradually. Reports show that 30% to 40% of STU demand could be electric. Some governments aim for 100% electric buses by 2030. Electrification will start with buses, then smaller vehicles, and niche areas in trucks. The proportion of sales to STUs and private orders was not discussed. Ashok Leyland is focusing on expanding their bus portfolio, which is becoming more profitable. The impact of COVID-19 on buses is decreasing as institutions reopen. STUs are ordering diesel buses, but the ratio of STU to private orders may change in the future. Government scrappage policies and intercity growth will impact private passenger transportation.

The transcript has been edited for readability. Ashok Leyland Limited discussed the introduction of electric trucks and their plans for the market. They are working on niche applications and conducting customer pilots. They want to mature the technology and work with large customers interested in electric vehicles. Gopal Mahadevan discussed the working capital situation, explaining that there is a pattern of working capital becoming positive in the first quarter. This is due to high demand and collections in February and March. In the following months, demand decreases and creditors need to be paid, resulting in a positive working capital. This caused a substantial movement from net cash to net debt.

Gopal Mahadevan mentioned that they have provided support of around Rs. 215 crores in terms of debt for Switch. The main reason for the increase in debt is working capital, which is expected to stabilize in the second and third quarter and improve in the fourth quarter. The working capital movement has increased from minus one or two days to plus nine days, resulting in a change in the debt situation. The debt has increased from Rs. 243 crores to Rs. 1,400 crores. There was no equity investment in Switch, but temporary short-term loans were given. The plan to support Switch with Rs. 1,200 crores for the current year will continue, and funds will be infused as needed.

In India, most EV buses are purchased by STUs through a build-operate model. Any plans to enter the EV bus market? Shenu Agarwal says it will take time due to ecosystem challenges. They are working with customers to develop the private sector segment. Currently, the only model for STUs is build-operate. Switch has won some tenders and is in discussions with other STUs. Amyn Pirani asks about the financials and profitability. Gopal Mahadevan suggests looking at it as a portfolio, as they aim to be a top global commercial vehicle manufacturer and need to expand their presence in India and in future fuels.

Ashok Leyland is involved in hydrogen fuel cell collaboration and has a separate company called Switch for EVs. OHM is a company that will house e-mobility as a service and long-term asset-based financing. OHM is not operational yet but will be in the future. OHM and HLF are similar in terms of asset lending, but OHM focuses on operating leases. The EV industry is still new, but Ashok Leyland is creating OHM to participate in the market. Customers may prefer owning and operating assets themselves. The next question is about defense revenue and product growth.

Shenu Agarwal mentioned that they have a wide variety of products in the land mobility scope, including normal vehicles like stallions and armored vehicles. They expect the next couple of years to be good for the business with ongoing discussions and tenders. Chirag asked about specific products, and Shenu Agarwal mentioned gun-towing vehicles and development on the Stallion. Gopal Mahadevan mentioned the possibility of achieving higher margins this year based on historical trends, but couldn't provide a specific percentage. He also shared that they achieved a 10% margin in Q1.

In Q2 2023, Ashok Leyland Limited had a 10% double-digit EBITDA, which was only 1% lower than the previous quarter. The revenues were Rs. 8,100 crores, approximately 30% lower than before, but the margins did not decrease significantly. The company's efforts in pricing, cost reduction, and overhead control contributed to this. The company aims to outperform the industry in various aspects. Last year, the company faced increased costs due to emission norm migrations and inflation. However, the industry had strong growth and price realization. Going forward, the focus will be on cost reduction and value engineering rather than increasing prices. This year will have different factors at play.

The meeting is coming to an end. Joseph George asks Shenu Agarwal if he wants to make closing comments. Shenu Agarwal thanks everyone and highlights positive Q1 results for Ashok Leyland. He mentions gains in market share and margins, especially in the MHCV and LCV sectors. He also talks about the contribution from defense, LCV, Aftermarket, and Power Solutions. The revenue mix and cost savings were favorable. They are satisfied with the performance and expect good demand in the future. They anticipate softness in commodity costs, which should help with margins. Joseph George also thanks everyone and concludes the meeting. The moderator then ends the conference and thanks everyone for joining.
