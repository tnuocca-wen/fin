The Auto Expo in Delhi showcased Ashok Leyland's range of alternate fuel products, including CNG, LNG, battery electric, hydrogen ICE, and fuel cell vehicles. Ashok Leyland plans to invest 1,200 crores in its Electric Vehicle Business, Switch. Switch will launch multiple electric vehicle models in the coming year. Q4 revenue was 11,626 crores, a 33% increase from the previous year. Q4 profit before tax and exceptional items more than doubled to 1,068 crores. For the full year, revenue was 36,144 crores, the highest ever for Ashok Leyland. EBITDA tripled to 2,931 crores. Profit after tax was 1,380 crores. Operating working capital is negative at 232 crores. Net debt was negative at 243 crores. Ashok Leyland is positive about the future of electric vehicles and aims for double-digit EBITDA margins.

Questions were asked about the expenses and EV business structure. The expenses have been controlled well. The company has optimized costs and kept administrative overhead low. The EBITDA margin has steadily improved over the past quarters. The company expects the industry to grow and wants to improve the bottom line further. There was a question about leasing EV buses to third-party companies.

Gopal Mahadevan discusses two major trends in the EV business: its growth and the evolving business models specific to India. E-Mobility as a service is one of the emerging models. Operators may start buying EVs from companies like ours and provide transportation services. The EV market will also impact intercity transporters and STUs. The industry needs to prepare for this shift, and our company is ready. The STU business will see a mix of ownership and e-mobility-as-a-service. Private sector ownership will also increase. Currently, EVs have higher capital costs but lower operating costs. Once operators secure funding, they may consider ownership models. Our company is open to all three models. Pramod Kumar asks about the current demand environment for CV cycles and whether growth will continue in the upcoming years. He also asks about demand in recent weeks and the outlook for the next month.

The industry is optimistic about long-term growth. Research predicts industry growth of 8% to 12%. They are optimistic that it will be at least 10% or more. Prebuying in Q4 may affect April, but growth is expected to resume. International sales are expected to improve. The cycle for commercial vehicles has a traditional growth of 3-4 years. FY'24 is looking good, and growth momentum is expected to continue beyond FY'24. The fleet industry is formalized, so engaging with large fleet owners can provide insight into areas of strength.

Ashok Leyland had growth in every product segment except for LCV, which is predicted to grow around 5-6% this year. The company remains optimistic about ICV, MAV, tractors, and haulage. They are focusing on beefing up their products and network in the ICV segment, especially in buses and trucks. They expect growth of around 30% in buses after the pandemic. Ashok Leyland is strong in the MDV side of buses and hopes to gain market share in both trucks and buses. They aim to achieve higher margins through modular program efficiency, cost control, and volume growth. They are optimistic about cost reduction opportunities and the benefits of product modularity.

Mukesh Saraf asked about the replacement mix and new fleet addition mix in terms of customer profile. Gopal Mahadevan mentioned that there has been an increase in primary demand in FY '22-'23. They are optimistic about growth in '24 due to the mix of large fleet operators and first-time buyers. First-time users are waiting for the industry to mature and interest rates are high. Replacement demand will start kicking in with the scrappage policy and government regulations on clean energy. The growth rates are difficult to predict, but the industry has seen surprising demand despite high interest rates. A 10% to 12% growth rate would be considered good for the industry.

The industry realizes it needs to invest in the future to increase profitability. The new modular AvTR platform-based products are being well accepted, especially in higher tonnage segments. Price realizations have improved and there is still potential for more. In April, there was a 2% price increase with good retention. It is important for the industry to improve pricing for sustainability. Positive factors include better pricing retention and decreasing commodity prices. The industry should aim for higher profit margins.

Gunjan Prityani from Bank of America has two questions. First, clarification on a 2% price increase in April and whether it relates to BS VI Phase II RDE transition. Shenu Agarwal explains that the price increase covers rising costs and to increase margins, not specifically related to RDE costs. Gunjan Prityani asks if the RDE-related cost is fully passed through, and Shenu Agarwal confirms it is. 
The second clarification is about commodity pricing cooling off and how much tailwind was seen in quarter 4. Gopal Mahadevan explains that steel prices peaked in the beginning of the year but cooled off later due to domestic and international factors. However, coking coal prices started to rise in the fourth quarter. Mahadevan expects steel prices to come down in Q2, Q3, Q4 due to lower demand from China and a domestic glut in Australia. Gunjan Prityani then asks about an investment in Switch mobility business and its duration and purpose.

Gopal Mahadevan clarified the loan situation for Switch. Switch is gaining acceptance quickly in India because of its backing from Ashok Leyland. They want to ensure the business plan of Switch continues while looking for investors. The Rs. 200 crore given earlier is a loan to Switch. The Rs. 1200 crore investment will be spread out over the next 12 months. Ashok Leyland has a strong balance sheet and will continue funding Switch's expansion. The funding is mostly needed for new product development, including a 12-meter bus for the European market. Switch is optimistic about the potential of this new platform. This year is a high capex year for Switch, mainly for new product development.

Kapil Singh asks about the company's capex and investment plans for FY '24. Shenu Agarwal says capex will be around Rs. 600 crores to Rs. 750 crores, with some going towards capacity augmentation and debottlenecking. Most capex will be for product development, especially in certain areas and product segments. Gopal Mahadevan says investments will mainly be in Switch, with no major investments in other areas. Kapil Singh asks about the consolidated net auto debt, and Gopal Mahadevan asks for another question while they find the number. Kapil Singh asks about revenue and profitability for Switch. Gopal Mahadevan says there will be launches in India and Europe, and profitability will come in the medium term. They have supplied to various organizations in the e-mobility-as-a-service sector.

The company is confident in the performance and uptime of its products. They expect the business to grow with the launch of more products. The EV business volumes will increase over the next couple of years. The customer order from VRL is seen as a reassurance of the new product's performance. Various factors contributed to getting the order back, including the relationship, product performance, and aftersales service. The company is proud of this achievement. The company aims to increase its market share in the short to medium term, and the launch of new products will support this goal.

Shenu Agarwal has a confident goal to reach mid-30s market share. North and East markets have improved significantly with a jump of 4-5% in market share. Network, dealers, and service reach have been crucial in this growth. The success of the AvTR modular platform has also contributed to the confidence. Shubam Shukla questions the company's debt levels. The long-term debt is 3,200 crores, short-term cash is 3,150 crores. The average cost of funds has been locked at low fixed rates.

The debt profile of the company won't be very high because they keep borrowing every year and manage long-term and short-term separately. During the COVID situation, this strategy helped the company as they had already funded their long-term requirements. There is sufficient headroom for borrowing if needed. The pressure on the balance sheet to go into debt will be lower as the industry grows with improved margins.

In quarter 4, the capex was around Rs. 180 crores, and the full-year capex was close to Rs. 500 crores, not Rs. 600 crores as previously assumed. The company has efficiently managed capex at these levels of revenue and volume.

The organization is focused on productivity, revenue maximization, cost efficiency, and better productivity from capex and facilities. This approach has resulted in a capex of just Rs. 500 crores for a company like Leyland.

The Q&A session has ended. Management will now give closing comments. Dheeraj Hinduja emphasizes the growth of the commercial vehicle market in India and believes it will continue to grow. He addresses concerns about Switch and highlights Ashok Leyland's success in the electric vehicle division. He mentions the company's confirmed order book and its operations in multiple geographies. He expresses optimism about the company's performance in the current year. Shenu Agarwal adds nothing further. The conference concludes.
