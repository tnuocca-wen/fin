Last quarter, TCS shared examples of client engagements using Gen AI for contract administration and customer service automation. This quarter, they executed similar projects focused on task automation for knowledge abstraction and content creation. Gen AI use cases are becoming more complex, from knowledge discovery to solutions for financial advisors, insurance underwriting, molecule discovery, and engineering design.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been hired by a UK retailer to assist with the establishment of a separate IT system and the digital transformation of its business. TCS will create a new digital core using cloud-based ERP platforms to improve various business functions, such as supply chain management and e-commerce processes. They will also implement new digital solutions to enhance employee experience and simplify the vendor landscape.

During the Q&A session, a question is asked about the BSNL deal, in which TCS clarifies its role as a system integrator and highlights the distribution of intellectual property (IP) between partners. Another question is asked regarding TCS's comparison to Accenture's outsourcing, to which TCS responds by emphasizing their focus on various types of engagements and growth and transformation. The session concludes with a question about the value of the BSNL deal, with TCS noting that the reported value is higher than their announced figure of $1 billion and suggesting it may be part of a larger program.

N G Subramaniam talked about the contract with BSNL for supply, installation, commissioning, design, and optimization of the network, which is valued at a little over $1 billion. Ravi Menon thanked him for the information. Nitin Padmanabhan asked about the demand and revenue growth. K Krithivasan explained that while they continue to win new deals, market uncertainty and customer cash conservation are affecting revenue growth. Nitin Padmanabhan also asked about furloughs, to which K Krithivasan stated that they are planning for a normal year. Kumar Rakesh asked about the revenue side, specifically regarding the impact of existing project rampdowns or reprioritization.

Long running projects are being reprioritized and some large programs have ended, causing a decrease in revenue. There is a focus on cost optimization, impacting revenue growth. The margin improvement in the second quarter is ahead of previous years. The company plans to continue using productivity and other levers to improve margins further. The completion of the BSNL deal will happen in 12 to 18 months, with revenue conversion and network maintenance over a longer period.

Sudheer understood there might be maintenance revenue in subsequent phases. N G Subramaniam said maintenance could be subsequent or concurrent. Sudheer asked about specific macro events that would lead clients to spend more. Krithivasan said clients are looking for signs of economic recovery. Sudheer asked if headcount reduction was due to attrition. Milind confirmed it was. Sandeep asked if deals would ramp up in the second half to reduce revenue impact. Krithivasan said all deals were yielding revenue as planned. Sandeep asked about second-half margins, considering headwinds from the BSNL deal and the $1 billion deal.

Samir Seksaria mentioned that they usually face challenges in the first quarter but gradually recover. However, the top line has been sluggish in the first two quarters. Despite this, they were able to deliver positive results in Q2. Sandeep Shah asked about the BSNL headwind, but Samir Seksaria stated that they manage margins at a portfolio level and don't address deal-specific headwinds. Vibhor Singhal inquired about the weak performance in the retail segment, and K Krithivasan acknowledged the challenges, stating that essential spending has also decreased. They anticipate growth once consumer spending picks up. However, they cannot predict when this will happen. They also mentioned that conversations with clients focus on growth forecasts and spending projections. Once there is certainty in these areas, the retail sector will start investing again. Currently, household savings in the US have decreased, creating uncertainty. They hope for positive macro indicators to indicate future growth.

Vibhor asked about the reason for the reduction in headcount. Milind explained that they have been hiring new talent for 18 months and they are now seeing the results. They have also decreased attrition, which led to a net reduction in hiring. Vibhor asked if this reduction will continue, considering attrition is easing off. Milind said they will consider all parameters and make the decision based on growth. He expects the reduction to continue or stabilize in the coming quarters. Abhishek asked about the ACV of the deals and K mentioned that it has remained similar. Abhishek also asked about investments in Gen AI and N mentioned that it is a net neutral from a demand perspective as both TCS and clients are investing in it.

The speaker believes that there is demand for a particular technology, but it is not very high. However, they think it will mature and have the potential to be embedded and embraced in their IT services value chain. In terms of revenue, the speaker expects the inflow of new orders to improve in the second half. There are no unusual project completions scheduled for the second half that would affect their optimism. The speaker mentions that utilization, productivity metrics, and subcontractor costs will continue to be important factors in the near term. There is then a transition to the next question from Mr. Rahul Jain, who wants to understand the rationale behind reassigning regional markets and others segment and what is left out and what region is now attributed to that segment.

The speaker wants to provide a global overview of an industry vertical. Revenue streams are being categorized based on stability and volatility. APAC and EMEA region revenues have been moved to industry verticals. India, Public Services, Japan, and Products & Platforms remain in Regional Markets and Others. The speaker confirms that Japan and Product & Platform are components in the regional market. The speaker explains that growth has occurred in various segments. The speaker concludes the call with financial updates and announcements.
