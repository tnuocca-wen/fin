Tata Consultancy Services Q2 performance showed strong demand for services, especially in cloud and cost optimization. Deal wins, order book, and pipeline are all robust. However, there was muted revenue growth due to completed transformation projects and downsized RTB projects. Revenue grew 7.9% in rupee terms, 2.8% in constant currency terms, and 4.8% in dollar terms. Operating margin was 24.3% and net margin was 19%. In Q2, revenue was `59,692 crore, a Y-o-Y growth of 7.9% in rupee terms. The operating margin expanded by 110 basis points sequentially. Net income was 19% and EPS grew 8.7% on a Y-o-Y basis. The board recommended an interim dividend of `9 per share and a buyback of `17,000 crore.

At the end of the second quarter, our workforce was 608,985 employees strong. Our strategy of hiring and training fresh talent is paying off. Our workforce is diverse with 152 nationalities and 35% women. We have invested in organic talent development. We have logged 26.4 million learning hours and acquired 2.6 million competencies. Our attrition rate is 14.9%, down 2.9% sequentially. We made changes in how we report segmental performance. We renamed our retail cluster to Consumer Business Group. Our segmental performance showed growth in Energy Resources and Utilities, Manufacturing, and Life Sciences and Healthcare. Growth was lower in Banking, Financial Services and Insurance, Communications and Media, and Technology and Services. North America and Continental Europe showed cautious growth, while the UK had good momentum.

Tata Consultancy Services had a strong quarter, with growth in emerging markets. Their products and platforms, including ignioâ„¢ and TCS BaNCS, performed well. The TCS BaNCS insurance platform had a major migration project, and the Quartz blockchain platform had new go-lives. TCS ADD Safety achieved a milestone of automating over 1 million cases. TCS iON had many new wins and administered assessments for millions of candidates. Their business model focuses on delivering value to clients, resulting in repeat business. They have deep client relationships and use contextual knowledge to develop their Gen AI capabilities. They have also seen an increase in the number of clients in various revenue brackets.

Client caution is causing a shift in spending towards cost optimization. This has led to an increase in large outsourcing deals, vendor consolidation, and operating model transformations. In Q2, there was a strong order book with a total contract value (TCV) of $11.2 billion. The BFSI sector had a TCV of $3 billion, while the consumer business had a TCV of $1.4 billion. Deals signed in North America had a TCV of $4.5 billion. In Q2, there were two mega deals, one with BSNL and one with JLR, each worth around $1 billion in TCV. TCS was selected by BSNL for a project involving the rollout of a modern mobile communication infrastructure across India. TCS Cognix, an AI-driven solution, played a significant role in operating model transformations and helped win 6 large deals. TCS also won a deal with the British Council to transform its professional services function. TCS' integrated operations model, known as Business-as-a-Service, and its AI-powered business command center have been successful in winning deals. TCS has also won a deal with a leading media company to improve customer retention and reduce engagement costs. Gen AI, TCS' AI technology, is driving conversations with IT and business leaders.

TCS is using Gen AI for various projects, including automating tasks like knowledge abstraction and content creation. They are also using Gen AI in more complex cases, such as financial advisors and insurance underwriting. TCS is helping a European airline and a US-based retailer with their Gen AI strategies. They are also using Gen AI in industries like construction, product innovation, and manufacturing. TCS believes that as the technology matures, it will be used for activity level automation and end-to-end value chain transformation. They have trained 100,000 employees on Gen AI and are launching an AI Playground for them to experiment with different platforms and technologies. TCS is also leveraging Generative AI in their products, including ignio, their AIOps product. They have enhanced ignio with a knowledge accelerator module and an intelligent conversation engine.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is using Ignio to create AI Assist, which helps users make data-driven decisions easily. TCS is also adding Gen AI plugins to TCS OmniStore for product discovery, personalized buying guides, store management automation, and marketing campaigns. They are introducing Generative AI to automate their product helpdesk and support operations. TCS Optumera will use Generative AI in the pricing process workbench. In life sciences, TCS is working on Gen AI-enabled solutions for drug development. TCS is partnering with a UK bank to help renters with bill splitting and credit profiles. They are also working with a Nordic insurer to create a mobility ecosystem. In the retail domain, TCS is helping retailers improve decision-making through data analysis. TCS is also helping a global fashion retailer optimize store layouts and improve visual merchandise planning. They are partnering with Kingfisher PLC to enhance customer and associate experience. Lastly, TCS won a large divestiture-related transformational engagement in the retail vertical.

Tata Consultancy Services has been hired by a UK retailer to help build a separate IT system and transform their business. TCS will create a new digital core by implementing cloud-based ERP platforms. They will also enhance employee experience and simplify the vendor landscape. TCS will assist the retailer in growing their e-commerce business, starting with grocery and apparel sites. The company is also migrating to the cloud. In the conference call, Ravi Menon asks about the BSNL deal and TCS clarifies that they are a system integrator and the intellectual property rests with their partners. Menon also asks about TCS's focus on growth and transformation compared to Accenture's consulting, and TCS explains that they are focused on multiple types of engagements and consulting is included in growth and transformation opportunities. Menon follows up on the value of the BSNL deal, and TCS confirms that the $1 billion figure is for phase 1 of the program.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has contracted with BSNL for supply, installation, commissioning, design, and optimization of the network, worth a little over $1 billion. The overall deal size is larger due to multiple factors. The company's revenue growth has been affected by reprioritization and cutting discretionary spending, causing projects to be slowed down or reprioritized into smaller chunks. The uncertainty in the market has led to customers conserving cash and optimizing current spending. TCS cannot predict how long this revenue slowdown will last. Furloughs are expected to be normal according to TCS's planning. TCS's deal wins have accelerated, exceeding $10 billion, but the incremental revenue from these new deals is not enough to offset the impact of existing project rampdowns or reprioritizations.

Long running projects are being reprioritized, leading to a decrease in revenue. The focus is on cost optimization, causing revenues to not increase alongside the increase in TCV. Margin improvement has been better than in the past, and the focus is on productivity, utilization, and subcontractor expenses. The completion of the BSNL deal will take 12 to 18 months, with revenue being generated from the installation of the network and potentially maintenance and operations afterwards. A good portion of the $1 billion deal is expected to be billed and collected within 12 to 18 months.

Maintenance revenue may come in subsequent phases. Annual maintenance contracts may be signed for completed zones. Clients are waiting for clear signs of economic recovery before increasing spending. Headcount reduction is due to attrition. Deals for cost reduction, outsourcing, and vendor consolidation are increasing. Revenue conversion from signed deals is on track. Margins may still increase in the second half despite potential headwinds.

Samir Seksaria said that typically, the first quarter is challenging but they gradually improve. However, the top line has been slow in the first two quarters. In Q2, they were able to deliver 110 basis points and credited specific initiatives for their success. Sandeep Shah questioned if the BSNL headwind would impact margins, but Samir clarified that they manage margins at an overall level and do not specify deal-specific headwinds. Vibhor Singhal asked about the weak performance in the retail segment and if there are any signs of improvement. K Krithivasan acknowledged the tough quarter in retail and mentioned that essential spending has also decreased. He expressed the need for consumer spending to pick up for growth to occur. He also mentioned that conversations with clients revolve around forecasting and spending projections. Once there is certainty in growth or spending, the retail sector will start investing.

Vibhor asked about the reduction in headcount this quarter and Milind explained that it was due to investing in fresh talent and lower attrition. Vibhor asked if the reduction will continue and Milind said it will depend on other factors like growth. Abhishek asked about deal wins and the ACV, and K Krithivasan said the ACV remained similar. Abhishek then asked about investments in Gen AI and N G Subramaniam said it is neutral as both the company and clients are investing in it.

The speaker discussed the potential value of a particular technology in various industries. They mentioned that there is demand, but it may not be very high. However, they believe that the technology will mature and have potential for widespread use in their IT services. The questioner asked about inflow of new work and project completions, and the speaker confirmed that the inflow should improve and there are no major project completions scheduled. The questioner also asked about margin levers and the speaker confirmed that utilization, productivity, and subcontractor costs will continue to be levers in the near term. The questioner then asked about the rationale for reassigning regional markets and others segment, but the next question was asked before a response was given.

The speaker wanted to provide a global overview of the industry verticals instead of regional breakdowns. They moved revenues from the APAC and EMEA regions to their respective industry verticals. India, Public Services, Japan, and Products & Platforms are still considered regional markets. The speaker clarified that a large portion of P&P is not implied to be in Japan and Europe. The company's revenue grew in Q2, but discretionary spending by clients affected their growth. They improved their operating margin and net margin. Generative AI is driving client conversations and they are investing in building capabilities in this area. Their order book is at $11.2 billion. They have adjusted their hiring strategy and reduced attrition. The board recommended a dividend and a share buyback. The call was concluded.
