Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan has the first question.
Ankur commends Rajesh for his leadership and congratulates Krithi on innovation.
Ankur asks about the change in demand commentary and the impact of recent events on sentiment.
Ankur also asks about visibility on demand and revenues for the first quarter and FY 24, and how client priorities and behavior may change if uncertainty continues.
Rajesh responds by saying there was softness in the US in Q3 but the expectation was for improvement in the New Year, which hasn't happened.
The negative sentiment is not limited to the banking industry and is affecting sectors across North America.
Krithi will address the question regarding the BFSI sector and future expectations.

Krithivasan mentioned weakness in BFSI due to market uncertainty. However, the order book is strong with smaller deals. Revenue conversion could be high. Immediate quarters guidance won't be given due to uncertainty, but they are comfortable with medium to long-term spending. The demand is still strong and the order book quality is good. If uncertainty continues, clients will continue to prioritize. Leadership change won't result in a drastic strategy change. TCS will tweak their strategy based on the market situation. Generative AI is interesting and has the potential to accelerate technology adoption. It can fundamentally change software delivery to clients.

Tata Consultancy Services is a tools-driven organization. They have a software called MasterCraft™ that generates software. They are excited about delivering proven code using low code, no code, or zero code approaches. They aim to build expertise around this capability and meet their clients' expectations. In the earnings conference call, Sudheer Guntupalli from Kotak Mahindra Asset Management asked about the shift towards cost optimization deals. K Krithivasan explained that these deals can be small and provide immediate benefits to customers. TCS has a less lumpy order book, with one mega deal and several medium to small-sized deals, which gives them confidence in faster revenue conversion. Sudheer Guntupalli also asked about the potential positive outcome for TCS in the banking sector. K Krithivasan stated that TCS has a strong presence in the banking sector and will work closely with clients to leverage market conditions and extra deposits.

Sudheer thanks Krithi and wishes Rajesh good luck. Rajesh thanks Sudheer. Moderator also thanks them. Sandeep thanks Rajesh and congratulates Krithi. Sandeep asks about the near-term pressure on IT spend. Krithi says Q4 was soft due to uncertainties, but they are comfortable with the order book. There may be cancellations if sentiment worsens. Sandeep asks about margin and on-site cost pressure. Samir says there were cost increases in the current quarter. FY 24 will have headwinds, but they are working on addressing them. It's difficult to give a timeline, but they are making progress on subcontractor costs.

Abhishek Kumar wants to know what is driving the growth in the UK market and if it can serve as a template for the US. Rajesh Gopinathan explains that in the UK, there is clarity and a realization that external factors won't change, so cost takeout and transformation projects are happening. They give examples of telecom and utility sectors where cost takeout and introduction of competition and agility are key. The UK market is not just about cost reduction, but also about new competitive forces and industry structure changes. TCS is actively participating and benefiting from this market. Rajesh believes that the UK market provides a playbook for technology's role in any market scenario, but it may not be a direct template for the US due to different starting bases. TCS aims to have a service portfolio that can participate in both challenging and growth scenarios.

Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA asks about the deal velocity in the quarter and if clients delayed decisions on deals. Rajesh Gopinathan responds that deal velocity has not reduced, in fact, it has accelerated, especially in Europe. They closed more deals in Europe this quarter than in the previous three quarters. Rajesh explains that they had called out delays earlier, but in Q4, they have seen an acceleration. The decision making in Europe has increased, which is encouraging. In the US, their Total Contract Value (TCV) has been strong throughout the quarter, both with existing and new customers. Rajesh states that the events of the last few weeks impacted client projects, causing a revenue impact, but deal decision making has not been impacted. It is a short-term impact that needs monitoring in the next quarter.

Pankaj Kapoor asked about the higher onsite cost and if it was already considered in previous calls. Samir Seksaria explained that it was not just subcontractors but also additional local hiring. The reason for not achieving the 25% exit margin was due to negative customer sentiments and paused discretionary projects. Gaurav Rateria asked about the conversion of the order book to revenue and the growth drivers for overall revenue in Europe. Rajesh Gopinathan declined to comment on ACV and mentioned that the order book was more weighted towards medium-sized deals. He also mentioned that Europe, especially BFSI, is complex.

Europe: different regions have different performance in BFSI. Nordics and Benelux are doing well, while Central Europe is complex. Each vertical and region will perform differently. Overall sentiment is improving, but growth is gradual. Rajesh explains the need to reorient the operating model due to travel restrictions and supply challenges. Contingent labor has increased, but they aim to decrease reliance and maintain quality. They are 25% lower in North America and will continue to improve. It's a multi-quarter journey for stability and resilience, not just cost-saving. This strategy positions them well in the current environment.

Ravi Menon asks if the negative growth in early quarters is a result of delays in decision making or a more permanent caution. Rajesh Gopinathan says there hasn't been a significant change in the deal pipeline yet, but they need more time to see how it plays out. Ravi Menon asks about the hiring range for the year, and Milind Lakkad says they don't have a specific number for gross hiring, but it depends on demand. Ravi Menon questions why they choose to replace attrition instead of addressing utilization when there's limited visibility into demand. Milind Lakkad says they're doing both, with a focus on talent development and hiring from the market. Vibhor Singhal asks if the growth in the retail vertical is still driven by the travel vertical and how non-travel parts are doing. They also inquire about client pricing discounts and the impact on profitability and growth during economic downturns.

On the retail side, TTH is doing well, but other segments have also performed well. Essential retail did well, but discretionary retail and fashion faced challenges. North America retail was weak, while North America travel did well. Overall, most segments were doing well, with travel and hospitality outperforming and North America retail underperforming. Pricing in the industry is disciplined and discounting is not as easy. The company will stay responsive to market conditions. The CEO expressed satisfaction with the company's performance in FY 23, with growth in revenue and a strong order book. Operating margin and net margin were consistent. LTM attrition in IT services decreased. The CEO thanked everyone for their positive sentiment and ended the call.
