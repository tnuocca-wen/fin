Even if the cost of electric buses goes up, there is still a significant gap between the average cost per kilometer of STUs and electric buses, making it highly remunerative for STUs to continue using electric buses. The funding for electric buses will largely come from the state side, as the central government will not provide much support. Some states, like Maharashtra, have their own subsidies for electric buses. The STUs are assuming the role of controlling the operations, except for fare collection, which further contributes to their profitability.

These discussions include not only financial support but also policy support and other enabling support. The discussions have been accelerating and are expected to reach a conclusion in the second half of the year. Tata Steel aims to come up with a plan for the future of its operations in the UK. The company is also in conversations with the Dutch government regarding support and a transition plan for its operations in the Netherlands. The discussions with both governments have been positive, and Tata Steel is hopeful for a favorable outcome. However, resolving the structural challenges in the UK may take time, and a different operating model may be considered in the long term.', 'The volatility of the steel market has affected working capital and efforts to manage it efficiently. This volatility is seen in the debtors and finished goods, as well as in the supply chain for coal and iron ore. Despite this volatility, the company optimizes the number of days in gross working capital. The volatility in the steel market has also impacted cash flows, resulting in a build-up of working capital. However, the number of days in working capital has remained stable. The fluctuating nature of creditors, particularly in relation to coal and iron ore purchases in Europe, affects the net effect on working capital. The company aims to manage this fluctuation to keep the creditor line as flat as possible. The efficiency of working capital is measured in terms of the number of days. The volatility in steel and coal prices affects the debtors and finished goods. The company continues to manage this volatility along with its peers. The execution of a project with Legal & General will result in a non-cash deferred tax charge in the future. The volatility in the steel market has led to a build-up of working capital, but the number of days has remained stable. The fluctuation in coal and steel prices is reflected in the working capital.

Detailed discussions are being held with the Netherlands government to find a balance between cash flows, government support, and project financing. The engineering work has already been done, and the transition can be supported by cash flows generated in the Netherlands. The goal is to be self-sufficient and take care of the project. Considerations are being made for a different operating structure and model. The aim is to ensure decarbonization in the Netherlands is primarily supported by government funding and internal cash flows. Extraordinary structural costs in the UK may impact cash flow. Repayments are scheduled until July 2024.', 'Tata Steel plans to bid for more iron ore mines in Odisha and Jharkhand to achieve self-sufficiency in iron ore by 2030. They also have the option to bid for their existing mines in 2030. The objective is to ensure full coverage of their iron ore requirements. They expect to produce 60-65 million tons of iron ore by 2030. They are currently focusing on developing the mines they have, and places like Gandhalpada will start producing iron ore in 2030.

Overall, we expect the Netherlands to have positive EBITDA for the whole year.', 'The company has consistently generated positive free cash flow and has a focus on future performance after relining. In FY22, it generated over €500 million of free cash. The expectation is that it will continue its positive performance after relining. The company is working towards being future-ready in terms of its cost structure for decarbonization. The Netherlands has been consistently free cash flow positive, generating about €200 million on average. The blast furnace relining is funded through internal cash and will reflect in the net debt. The relining is expected to be completed by the end of the next quarter, and the Netherlands will return to normal operating levels. The company expects to continue its positive performance in the market. The relining of BF6 will impact performance in the next quarter, but there will be product mix improvement and cost efficiencies in the future.

In the US and EU, elevated interest rates to manage inflation have negatively affected demand. In China, the weak property market has continued to impact prices. In India, steel prices were influenced by global sentiment but experienced a smaller drop compared to other markets. The economic slowdown in key regions has also affected global commodity prices. China has increased steel exports, leading to a moderation of global steel prices. Despite good domestic demand in India, steel spot prices have declined in line with international prices.', ""The impact of global sentiment on steel prices in India was not as severe as in other markets. Steel prices in India dropped by 3% compared to other key markets. Despite this, the demand for steel in India remained resilient. The net realizations in India declined by about Rs. 2,400 per ton on a quarter-on-quarter basis. In the US and EU, elevated interest rates and a slowdown in economic activity affected steel prices. In China, weakness in the property market also had an impact on prices. However, India's steel prices were less affected due to strong domestic demand. China's higher steel exports led to a moderation of global steel prices. The economic activity in India improved, resulting in a 10% year-on-year increase in apparent steel consumption. Despite good domestic demand, steel spot prices in India declined in line with international prices. Tata Steel continues to focus on creating sustainable value and responsible growth. The US and EU face inflationary pressures and tight monetary policies, while China's recovery has been slower than expected. The concern is more about Chinese exports across the world, which have reached 8 million tons per month. The hope is that China will reduce its exports in the coming months, leading to more stable steel prices internationally."", 'Tata Steel has received recognition for its innovative approach to risk management.
