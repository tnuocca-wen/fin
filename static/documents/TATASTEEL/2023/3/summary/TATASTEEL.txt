In the quarter, our revenues were Rs. 57,084 crores with an EBITDA margin of about 7%. Standalone EBITDA margin was about 18%. The drop in European realizations and spreads affected overall profitability. At Tata Steel standalone, EBITDA was Rs. 5,334 crores, translating to Rs. 11,623 per ton. Excluding forex impact, EBITDA was about Rs. 4,763 crores, up 15% QoQ. India steel prices remained subdued due to extended monsoon and construction stoppage. Raw material prices, including coking coal, were lower. Costs dropped more than the decline in net realization, leading to margin expansion. In Tata Steel Europe, there was an EBITDA loss of about £166 million due to lower realizations and higher costs. The currency markets were volatile, resulting in a forex gain of Rs. 1,427 crores at the consolidated level. Taxes for the quarter were about Rs. 2,905 crores, comprising current tax and non-cash deferred tax charge. Progress was made in de-risking the British Steel Pension Scheme. Operating cash flow for the quarter was about Rs. 5,000 crores, driven by favorable working capital movement. We continue to invest in growth and our net debt remains stable at about Rs. 71,706 crores with strong liquidity of over Rs. 15,000 crores.

In this year, we were unable to reduce our debt due to high volatility in earnings and working capital. Our focus is on completing the Tata Steel Kalinganagar project. We acquired NINL for Rs. 10,000 crores and paid dividends of over Rs. 6,000 crores. Despite this, our net debt to EBITDA is within target levels. We plan to continue reducing debt in FY24 and meet our target of $1 billion. The next few quarters are expected to be weaker for TSE, with lower realizations and impacts from blast furnace relining. We are facing challenges with heavy assets in Tata Steel UK and rising carbon costs. The UK government has provided support for our transition to a low carbon configuration. We are evaluating the offer and developing investment options. Meanwhile, Tata Steel UK will be run optimally with minimal support from Tata Steel India.

The expenditure was higher than expected in November. The realizations in 3Q were lower than 2Q in India. The drop in coal consumption cost was lower than expected. Relief on export duty came later than expected. NINL is currently a drag on earnings but production is increasing. The return on investment for NINL is based on expanding capacity. The expansion will happen once the 1 mn ton operating rate is reached. There is a provision for offsetting tax payment with profits in Tata Steel Europe.

During the meeting, there were discussions about offsetting in Tata Steel UK and the possibility of NRV provisions. The company has stocked up slabs in the Netherlands, but if prices don't fall significantly, there shouldn't be any major NRV concerns. The goal is to reduce inventory levels by the end of March. There were also talks about lower negotiated contracts in the future and the impact of NRV provisions on costs. Overall, the company expects higher spot prices and a margin expansion per ton this quarter.

The blast furnace shutdown is planned for about 120 days. Tata Steel Netherlands has €600 million of cash and does not require money from India. The UK still needs cash infusion. Tata Steel will continue to push for working capital release. Coking coal prices fluctuate between $250 and $350 per ton. China has managed without buying Australian coking coal in the past.

The company has been buying from Russia but has developed alternate sources recently. The profitability of the company has not reached the targeted levels due to energy costs and gas costs. The Netherlands business has been positive, but the UK has challenges with higher energy costs and end-of-life issues. Netherlands should continue to be cash positive and not need support from India. Inflation has impacted costs. The capex for relining seems high and there may be a requirement for conversion in the UK.

The idea is to convert it to a standalone EAF with lower capex required. Europe's relining cost is comparable to the $275 million cost. The blast furnace will run until 2035. Speculative media reports about the UK numbers. The proposal to the government is not just about an EAF but also about the hot strip mill and other assets. Looking at the best option based on government support and available funds. There are two blast furnaces in the Netherlands, one due for relining in 2026-2027. In the UK, there are assets reaching the end of their useful life. Proposal to transition into a greener option.

The UK has a lot of scrap and exports it, but the energy cost in the UK is twice as high as in Europe. The government was asked for support in funding 50% of the necessary spending and for policy support on energy costs to not be at a disadvantage compared to Europe. Steel companies in Europe also ask for support in the form of grants for capex and support for operating costs when transitioning to gas and hydrogen. They also request a level playing field in terms of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The aspirational Return on Invested Capital for the UK operations is 15%. The cost of capital in Europe is around 9-10%. Steel prices in India reflect international trends, with an expected increase in the coming months. Demand in India has been strong.

Import prices are not currently a big threat due to the strengthening of the yen. The steel industry in India needs better cash flows for growth. The annual volume guidance will be provided in due course. The Neelachal plant will contribute 1 million tons of steel next year. The Kalinganagar plant will also provide additional volumes, and the Ludhiana plant will be operational in two years. The ramp-up sequence of Kalinganagar expansion will take place and result in cost savings for Tata Steel. The blast furnace of Kalinganagar will be operational in FY25.

- Kalinganagar Phase 1 ramp-up was one of the fastest for a greenfield site.
- The ramp-up took about 16 months.
- The blast furnace in Kalinganagar will be one of the biggest in India.
- Tata Steel and its subsidiaries have a spread of 12% to 15%.
- The market is pricing the merger to conclude in 1 to 1.5 years.
- Tata Steel expects to get clearances and close the merger within a year.
- Auto sector accounts for 15% of Tata Steel's volumes.
- Growth in the auto sector depends on the pace of the automotive segment.
- Tata Steel already has a 50% market share in the auto sector.
- The company will focus on increasing market share in galvanized and cold roll anneal products.
- Auto sector will continue to account for 15% to 20% of Tata Steel's overall volume.
- The company is also pursuing the Oil and gas sector for value-added sales.
- There is a question about why Tata Steel does not do merchant sales for iron ore.

Tata Steel is using its iron ore for captive use and will consider auctioning unused iron ore. They have faced logistics challenges but have begun transporting iron ore. They have not confirmed if they will bid for RINL assets. They do not provide quarterly guidance. The implementation of CBAM proposal in Europe will benefit Tata Steel as it will help offset the cost of CO2 emissions. They expect steel prices in Europe to reflect the unique costs in Europe. The company has been affected by energy costs and may report them separately for Europe and India. Tata Steel provides more comprehensive profit and loss details compared to other companies in the steel industry.

- Koushik Chatterjee mentioned that they have already paid off some debt in the third quarter, but it got offset by currency valuation. They prioritize completing Kalinganagar and reducing debt.
- Samita Shah asked about profitability in Europe for the fourth quarter and asked for clarification.
- T. V. Narendran clarified that profitability in Europe will improve compared to the third quarter due to lower costs.

- T. V. Narendran mentioned that they are responding to notices and improving their operations to address environmental concerns.
- Samita Shah asked about the large forex gain in this quarter and requested details.
- Koushik Chatterjee explained that the gain is due to FX movements and adjustments in Tata Steel Holding's debt mechanism.
- Tarang Agarwal from Oldbridge Capital asked three questions about Europe and India, which were not summarized.

The total cost for the last four to five quarters has been above €1,000 per ton.
Tata Steel has downstream assets in Europe, and the costs versus realizations are not yet concluded.
The cash between Netherlands and UK is fungible and moves freely across entities.
In terms of realizations, automotive contracts have different tenures and depend on market conditions.
Auto customers look for approved suppliers, which limits competition.
IPP is volume-based and has a value-added aspect.
Transfer pricing policies in the downstream business may cause a lag in passing on price increases.
Auto and downstream businesses provide stability, while IPP is leveraged when stable businesses have low volumes.

The first question is about the cost and funding of the transformation from BF to EAF in the UK.
Tata Steel originally asked for 50% government support, but received only partial support.
They are now reconsidering the configuration and resizing the project.
The specific amount requested in terms of billion dollars is not mentioned.
Tata Steel will work on a plan that matches the partial government grant.
The remaining funding for the project may come from a combination of Tata Steel support and external sources.
There is no fixed timeline for closing the deal with the government.
There are plan B and plan C options if the current plan does not work out.

Tata Steel's CEO wants to discuss plans with stakeholders before announcing them. The net steel realization for this quarter in India is expected to be higher than last quarter. Coal costs are expected to be lower this quarter. Profitability in the UK is not expected to worsen, but it won't improve either. The commercial volumes from KPO phase 2 will start from next year, and incremental volume will come from FY25. Cash breakeven for Europe is expected towards the end of FY24 or FY25. Netherlands is not a challenge, but the UK is. The coking coal pricing issue needs a new dialogue or system based on mutual long-term relationship

In free markets, power shifts between customers and suppliers. Customers complain when steel prices increase. Coking coal market is not very liquid. Small miners are not getting enough funding. India relies heavily on Australia for coking coal. Weather events and railway problems affect coking coal prices. The steel industry feels global indexes are not reflective of the market. Tata Steel and suppliers do what they believe is best for their shareholders. India is the largest coking coal importer. Indian steel capacity will double in the next 10 years. NRV losses in Europe were £55 million. Tata Steel aims to be self-sufficient in pellets by building pellet plants.

The iron ore expansion will keep pace with steel expansion. We have 550 million tons of iron ore reserves for post 2030. We have acquired mines from Gandhalpada, Bhushan, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, and Usha Martin. We will continue to participate in auctions and explore options for existing mines in 2030. Thank you for joining the call.
