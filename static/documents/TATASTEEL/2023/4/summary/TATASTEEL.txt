Tata Steel held an analyst call to discuss their Q4 results & year-end results for 2023. CEO T.V. Narendran and CFO Koushik Chatterjee provided opening remarks. Global commodity prices recovered in Q1 but faced an uncertain operating environment. Steel prices were higher in March compared to December. Economic activity in India improved, with steel consumption up 14% YoY in Q4. Tata Steel achieved highest-ever crude steel production in India. Deliveries grew 9% QoQ and net realizations improved. Tata Steel is committed to net zero emissions by 2045 and pursuing initiatives to reduce emissions. Multiple growth projects are underway in India, aiming for 40 million tons production. In Europe, steel deliveries were 2.1 million tons in Q4. Tata Steel has been recognized for sustainability and diversity & inclusion efforts. Consolidated revenue was Rs. 62,962 crores and EBITDA was Rs. 7,225 crores with a margin of 11%. Tata Steel Standalone EBITDA was Rs. 8,089 crores with an EBITDA per ton of Rs. 16,258. Margin expansion was seen in the quarter.

Material costs decreased, but conversion costs increased due to royalty expenses and FX impact on intercompany loans. Royalty increased because of higher production and notified IBM prices. There was a loss in FX impact compared to the gain in the third quarter. Overall, EBITDA margin improved from 18% to about 24%. Tata Steel Long Products turned EBITDA positive within 9 months of acquiring NINL. Tata Steel Europe had an EBITDA loss of about £176 million, which was similar to the third quarter. Deliveries increased by about 9% but revenue dropped, leading to lower-than-expected revenues. Energy costs did not decrease as much as spot prices because of hedges. Taxes for the quarter decreased due to lower non-cash deferred tax. The full de-risking of the pension fund exposure is currently underway. Tata Steel UK is expected to be adversely impacted by the economic downturn in Europe. An impairment charge of Rs. 11,070 crores was taken in the Tata Steel Standalone books. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased due to better working capital management. Consolidated revenues for the full year were stable at Rs. 2.4 lakh crores or $30 billion. Standalone EBITDA margin was higher at 22%, while Europe was at 5%. Standalone EBITDA per ton was Rs. 15,467 and TSE EBITDA per ton was about £58.

In the last quarter, we spent Rs. 4,396 crores on capex and Rs. 14,142 crores for the full year. We made progress with strategic projects like the pellet plant and PLTCM line at Kalinganagar. In FY2024, we plan to invest about Rs. 16,000 crores in capex, with a focus on the Kalinganagar project. Our free cash flow for the quarter was Rs. 4,800 crores and our net debt decreased to Rs. 67,810 crores. Despite rate hikes, our interest cost remained stable. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 2.07x and net debt to equity ratio is 0.61x. We aim to reduce leverage and continue deleveraging in FY2024. The Board has recommended a dividend of Rs. 3.6 per share.

Europe spreads have improved dramatically, expecting break-even profitability in the coming quarters. India's quarter is expected to be Rs. 1,000-1,200 higher per ton. Europe's quarter will be £15 per ton higher. Coal costs will be higher this quarter in both India and Europe. No benefit yet from dropping gas prices in Europe, but it will play out over the next two quarters. 1Q volumes will be lower than 4Q. UK plant reaching end of life in next 12 to 24 months, decision will be made if no government support. European operations have been showing integrity and commitment for 15 years.

The CEO and MD of Tata Steel, T. V. Narendran, mentions that government help will be needed in both the Netherlands and UK. The Dutch business has been strong and does not require support from India. It generates its own free cash flows. In contrast, the UK business does not have sufficient cash flows to support the transition and investment. Government support is important to level the playing field. Koushik Chatterjee, ED & CFO of Tata Steel, agrees with the CEO's summary and states that they will discuss the plans in detail when the time comes. Another question is asked about the possibility of more working capital release in the coming quarters. Koushik Chatterjee responds that significant working capital release was seen in the last quarter and they are working on improving efficiency to drive even better working capital. They will also look at working capital release throughout the year, especially in Europe, to generate internal cash flows for the business.

Pinakin Parekh from JP Morgan wants to know the cash burn in Europe in the second half of FY23 and the total cash loss. Koushik Chatterjee from Tata Steel says there is no cash burn in the Netherlands, they have €600 million in cash. For FY2024, Tata Steel has a capex guidance of Rs. 16,000 crores. Rs. 10,000 crores is for standalone India, Rs. 6,000 crores is for subsidiaries in Europe. Tata Steel Netherlands will spend Rs. 3,000 crores from their own cash and UK will spend between Rs. 600 to 800 crores. JP Morgan wants to know the amount of capital support required in the UK. Koushik Chatterjee says it is hundreds of millions and not billions.

The company needs to address cash flow issues with various stakeholders including the government and unions. They are looking for alternative solutions with value-adding investments. They expect to resume deleveraging this year at approximately $1 billion, with more progress in the second half of the year. Questions were raised about refinancing UK debt and the need for government support for downstream assets. The company clarified that the debt is already reflected in their balance sheet and the letter of comfort is not adding any additional burden.

The government support we have asked for is for the full kit, including upstream, midstream, and downstream. The project size is more than £1 billion. We are working on minimizing exposure and honoring stakeholders who provided capital. Regarding the capex, the budgeted amount for KPO-2 is Rs. 7,000 crores. The outlet for the capacity of flat steel could be in the domestic market and strategic exports.

Tata Steel spent Rs. 17,000 crores on the Kalinganagar expansion in the past few years, with Rs. 6,500 crores spent in the last financial year. They plan to spend similar amounts this year. The project is on track and was only slowed down for a year or two. 

Alok Deora from Motilal Oswal asked about the consumption cost of coking coal and the benefits in the second quarter. T. V. Narendran, CEO & MD of Tata Steel, mentioned that the consumption cost was $267/t in the fourth quarter, and it is now expected to be around $277/t. They are buying the coal at a lower price compared to the previous quarter, with a potential drop of $25/t in the next quarter if prices continue to soften. In Europe, the cost is $7/t higher than last quarter but purchasing is about $35/t lower so far.

Alok Deora also asked about global steel prices and the outlook in the near to medium term. Narendran stated that China's shift towards consumption-led growth and their increased steel production and exports had an impact on global steel prices. The drop in coal prices also affected the market.

Coal prices have dropped, causing steel prices to also drop in China. However, there is not much margin for steel companies in China at the moment. If coal prices go below $200/t, it will have a different impact. Input costs globally are settling in, such as gas and electricity prices in Europe. Some industries in Europe that were suffering due to high energy prices may see a slight improvement. Overall, this year is expected to be better than last year in terms of volatility. The effective production for this year will be 1.5 million tons higher than last year on a consolidated basis. In Europe, there will be a production shutdown for maintenance, but more sales are expected as slabs will be rolled into hot rolled coils. Working capital will be released and more sales and production will be achieved. There has been ongoing cash support from TS Holdings to TSUK for audit purposes, but it is not a guarantee or binding agreement.

Various stress tests are done, including a test of the company's ability to support or refinance loans. Tata Steel provides an intent letter, not a guarantee, for loan renewals. There is no change in policy, and the focus is on ensuring businesses are cash neutral to cash positive. The drop in RM cost in India Standalone business is due to royalties coming with a lag. The IBM prices, which are benchmarked to international prices, also have a lag. The exact number can be provided offline. A question is asked about the company's use of hydrogen in operations.

Tata Steel is exploring different solutions for reducing carbon footprint in steel production, depending on the region. In Europe, the plan is to transition from coal to gas and eventually to hydrogen. In India, the challenge is the availability of gas, so they are looking at injecting hydrogen into blast furnaces. They are also setting up a recycling-based unit in Ludhiana. In the Netherlands, Tata Steel is hopeful of government support and their transition to hydrogen is important for the country's hydrogen ecosystem. The Dutch assets have positive cash flow, unlike the UK. There is a question about the increase in NR (Net Realization) on a sequential basis and the gap between the blended number and the sequential increase.

Samita Shah, VP CFTRM of Tata Steel, discusses the income from operations, specifically for steel NR, which is Rs. 1,700/t. 
Koushik Chatterjee, ED & CFO of Tata Steel, suggests breaking up the income between NR and other sources.
Ritesh Shah from Investec asks about impairments in the UK and the potential for more impairments in the future. He also mentions the exposure through loans and investments, which is over Rs. 20,000 crores.
Koushik Chatterjee explains that investments are reviewed annually or semiannually based on the value-in-use assessment. He mentions the write-off of PPE in the UK and the calibration down of standalone investments by about Rs. 1,100 crores. The investments will be reassessed regularly.
Kirtan Mehta from BoB Capital asks for clarification on investment numbers in the India's books towards the UK and Europe. Koushik Chatterjee explains that the investment numbers reflect Europe, with flow from Tata Steel India to the overseas holding company.
Kirtan Mehta also asks about the delay in the ramp-up of the cold mill at IJmuiden and its impact on the margin of the Netherlands plant.

The plant had an upgrade but faced problems afterwards.
A subcontractor went bankrupt, causing complications.
The ramp-up post-upgrade did not happen as quickly as desired.
Now working closely with the main contractor to improve.
Force majeure had to be announced due to the mill supplying to auto customers.
Looking to withdraw force majeure soon.
Product mix impacted numbers for the last 2 quarters.
Long-term margin is around Rs. 14,000 - 15,000/t.
Rs. 15,000 is slightly higher than the range.
The pellet plant and cold roll mill will have an impact.
Pellet plant adds 6 million tons of pellets.
Cold rolling mill adds 2 million tons of value-add.
Pellet plant cost advantage depends on pellet price.
Cold rolling mill advantage is lower than usual.
The mill is one of the most advanced in the world.

Tata Steel is expanding its high-end auto production to increase profit margins. They aim to surpass Rs. 15,000 in EBITDA. Iron ore will be self-produced, but some coking coal will be imported. A coal expansion in West Bokaro is underway. The company is undergoing restructuring in Europe. Impairments are assessed regularly based on cash flows and future value. Tata Steel imports 15 million tonnes of coking coal, with 8-10 million tonnes used in India. The quantity of quarterly contracts is unclear.

- Funding for UK questioned, funding not affected by impairment
- Closure cost of UK business depends on discussions with stakeholders
- Total capex spent on Kalinganagar Rs. 17,000 crores, remaining Rs. 3,000-4,000 crores
- Timeline for NINL expansion proposal to be presented during this financial year
- Working capital unlocking will contribute to debt reduction of $1 billion
- Interest cost maintained despite increase in benchmark rates and gross debt through long-term, short-term arbitrage and deleveraging efforts
- Green hydrogen project in early stages, potential cost savings with hydrogen injection in blast furnace, aim for green hydrogen at lower cost for DRI reduction. Proposal submitted for blast furnace conversion in Netherlands.

By 2030, one blast furnace will be replaced with a gas-based or hydrogen-based DRI line. By 2035, the other blast furnace will also be replaced, making the unit completely gas or hydrogen-based. The exact timelines will be determined after further discussions with the government. As for the trial of hydrogen injection at the Jamshedpur plant, no government support has been received for procuring hydrogen at a cheaper cost. Injecting hydrogen into the blast furnace is a significant achievement, and the process will be gradually accelerated. The merger of Tata Steel Long Products is in progress, with NCLT hearings and motions happening sequentially for each company. The purpose of the merger is to drive synergies. The iron ore mines are running and supplying the Neelachal plant at an annualized rate of 1.5 million tons. The capex spend on KPO is Rs. 17,500 crores, but the CWIP on the balance sheet is Rs. 30,000 crores, leaving a balance of Rs. 12,500 crores as of March 31, 2023.

Tata Steel has several projects including KPO and infrastructure development in iron ore mines. They have ongoing sustenance capex in various facilities. Chinese steel producers are cutting production due to low demand and sustainability concerns. Global steel demand depends on China's performance, but India, Europe, and the US show positive trends. Steel trade as a percentage of production has decreased over the years. In India, there may be slightly lower volumes in the first quarter, but sectors like auto and commercial vehicles show strong growth. Shutdowns are common in the first quarter. Steel demand may be impacted by pre-election spending.

Indian demand is strong in various sectors such as tractors, industrial construction, infrastructure, and commercial spaces. Residential demand is mixed. The only area of concern is Indian customers who depend on export markets for steel products. The pre-election impact on steel demand is expected to be positive due to infrastructure projects. There are questions about the impairment of European assets and the future impact. The exact numbers are hard to predict, but the standalone impact is expected to be higher than the consolidated impact. Any impairment will not have a cash impact except for closure costs.

Tata Steel aims for residual business to be cash-free.
There's time for one more audio question before the call ends.
Ashish Jain asks how Tata Steel funds UK's cash losses.
Koushik Chatterjee explains that working capital arrangements provide cash flow.
Worst case scenario, the losses fall on Tata Steel India.
Tata Steel has one balance sheet that covers all its operations.
Kalinganagar's blast furnace is expected in the next 12 months.
