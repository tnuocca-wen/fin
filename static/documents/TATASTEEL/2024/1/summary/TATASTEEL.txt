Tata Steel executives and analysts participated in a conference call. Samita Shah welcomed everyone and introduced T.V. Narendran and Koushik Chatterjee. Narendran discussed the impact of global economic slowdown on commodity and steel prices. He mentioned higher steel exports from China, which led to a moderation of global steel prices. In India, economic activity improved, but steel spot prices declined. Tata Steel's crude steel production in India was around 5 million tons, up 2% year-on-year. India deliveries grew 18% year-on-year, driven by domestic deliveries.

Tata Steel had a strong first quarter sales, especially in the automotive and retail sectors. Net realizations improved due to contract sales and product mix. In Europe, steel deliveries were around 2 million tons, with revenue per ton increasing. The blast furnace relining impacted the first and second quarters. Tata Steel is focused on expanding in India and leveraging growth in steel end-use segments. They have leading market share in auto and plan to expand in value-added segments. They are also expanding their virtual presence through e-commerce platforms. Tata Steel is committed to being Net Zero by 2045 and has initiatives to reduce emissions. They are also exploring green steel technology. In India, domestic demand is supported by government spending, but international prices have dropped. However, the drop in coking coal consumption will benefit Tata Steel. In Europe, net realizations are expected to drop due to relining and improving coking coal consumption. The upgradation of the cold rolling mill is being resolved.

In the meeting, it was mentioned that the consolidated EBITDA was around Rs. 6,122 crores with a margin of 10%. The standalone EBITDA for Tata Steel was Rs. 7,348 crores, with an EBITDA per ton of Rs. 15,895. Excluding forex impact, the EBITDA was slightly higher at about Rs. 7,403 crores. The drop in EBITDA was due to lower volumes compared to the previous quarter. Material costs were down, but conversion costs increased due to royalty expenses. Neelachal operations improved profitability within 9 months of acquisition. Tata Steel Europe had an EBITDA loss of about £153 million, with lower steel production and deliveries. Other income increased by Rs. 1,000 crores due to standalone accounts. Taxes were about Rs. 1,331 crores, with current tax in line with India operations. The British Steel Pension Scheme has been successfully derisked. There has been a build-up of working capital due to volatility in the steel markets. Capital expenditure in India was about Rs. 4,089 crores during the quarter and about Rs. 15,500 crores in the last 12 months. The Kalinganagar expansion plan and cold rolling mill commissioning will drive volumes. The ongoing relining of the BF6 in IJmuiden was mentioned.

TSN operations are financing 3's internal accruals. The cold mill (CM21) upgrade is almost complete. BF6 relining will affect performance next quarter, but there will be product mix improvement from the upgrade. Neelachal is operating close to its capacity of 0.9 million tons. The coke plant will be commissioned this quarter, driving cost efficiencies in the future. Net debt has increased by Rs. 3,600 crores on a QoQ basis, reaching Rs. 71,397 crores. Finance costs are stable. Net debt to EBITDA is 2.9x, and net debt to equity is 0.69x. Group liquidity is strong at Rs. 30,500 crores. Growth in India is a priority, but deleveraging targets are being recalibrated. Sustainability is core to the strategy with comprehensive disclosures. The UK government supports a decarbonised and competitive future for the steel industry. Tata Steel's performance and future are discussed. 

The first question is about the outlook for Europe's division returning to breakeven and positive EBITDA over the next few quarters. There have been losses for the past 3 quarters, and targets for the next 1 to 2 years are discussed. Tough decisions may be made based on return on capital employed.



The drop in production has resulted in the distribution of fixed costs over a lower production. The UK is facing challenges due to softer steel prices, but there are ongoing conversations with the government for a long-term solution. In the Netherlands, there is a plan to bring operating performance back to normal levels in the second half of the year. The UK has structural challenges that are being addressed. In the next quarter, there will be pressure on prices and the relining in the Netherlands will be completed by the early part of the third quarter. Netherlands is expected to continue being strong in the market and historically has been a profitable business. Efforts are being made to structurally improve it. The cost structure in the Netherlands will align with decarbonization in a few years. In the UK, a similar performance is expected in the next couple of quarters, and a different operating structure will be considered in the long term. Capacity expansion plans include the commissioning of KPO-2 blast furnace towards the end of the year and reaching 40 million tons by 2030. The strategy for iron ore, considering auctions of mines, is not specified.

Tata Steel Kalinganagar's cold rolling mill and pellet plant are operational. The galvanising and annealing lines will be commissioned in the next few quarters. The blast furnace is expected to start by February-March. The steel melt shop will add another caster, increasing volume by 0.5 million tons. The full benefit will come once the blast furnace and steel melt shop expansion are complete. The cost impact is already being felt due to the commissioning of the pellet plant. The cold rolling mill will improve margins. The steel melt shop's additional volume will come in the second half of the year. Tata Steel plans to bid for more iron ore mines to secure supply. The objective is to manage the cost of iron ore. Tata Steel expects positive EBITDA for the Netherlands business in the second half and for the whole year. The current spreads are better than last year.

Electricity and gas prices have increased to €120 per ton but are settling back to €70-90 per ton. The Netherlands is back on track in the second half of the year, but the UK is still a challenge. The goal is for the Netherlands to have positive EBITDA from the third quarter onwards. Structural cost reductions in the Netherlands and UK will be reflected in the second half results. The target for net debt to EBITDA is between 2x and 2.5x. Deleveraging is a priority, but growth in India is also important. The aim is to bring net debt to EBITDA back to 2.5x by the end of the year. The relining of blast furnaces in the Netherlands and the capex for the transition were discussed. There was also mention of a carbon border adjustment tax and the means for European steel companies to generate ROCE on decarbonization capex.

Tata Steel is planning to transition from blast furnaces to DRI-based production with an electric arc furnace in the Netherlands. Discussions are ongoing about the phasing of the right technology and the cash flow support from the government. The carbon border adjustment mechanism is linked to the carbon tax in Europe. Tata Steel's Dutch plant has a low carbon footprint compared to their plant in Jamshedpur, India. The mechanism aims to ensure fair competition by penalizing higher carbon footprint industries. Tata Steel expects to remain competitive as they transition to a greener process route. The CBAM requires companies to produce products with equal or lower carbon than European standards. Tata Steel currently applies a $40 internal carbon pricing but needs to reduce its carbon footprint to match the average levels specified by CBAM in 2026. The transitions in Europe aim for a sustainable business and investment case.

Pinakin Parekh asked if the $1 billion net debt reduction target is still valid, and if debt to EBITDA should be considered instead. Koushik Chatterjee clarified that the net debt to EBITDA frame of 2x - 2.5x is still the target, but they will continue to pursue the $1 billion debt reduction. However, the repayment of Rs. 7,200 crores in this quarter had to be partly refinanced, so it doesn't appear in the debt reduction number. Going forward, they have Rs. 4,500 crores to repay in the next quarter. Chatterjee mentioned that there is some volatility in coal and steel prices affecting working capital. He stated that they haven't given up on the $1 billion target and will keep working on it, while also increasing capex allocation. He noted that deleveraging has been prioritized over capex in the past, but they will continue to push for both. Pinakin Parekh then asked about the risk of unforeseen spending in Europe affecting the $1 billion net debt reduction target. Chatterjee acknowledged the risk and mentioned the impact of capex allocation in the past. He also explained that cash sitting in Netherlands and funding for blast furnace relining will affect the net debt number. Extraordinary structural costs in the UK could also take cash out of the system, but they are working towards reducing cash bleed and achieving a neutral or positive zone by July 2024.

Tata Steel has two targets - repaying scheduled repayments and optimizing cash for restructuring in Tata Steel UK. The energy hedges have been impacting numbers. They hedge 3 quarters at 25% every quarter. The highest impact was in 1Q, but it will drop in subsequent quarters. The hedges wear out and energy prices are more range bound now. The details of the hit in 1Q can be shared. In FY22, they benefited from hedges which lowered costs. In FY24, there will be some impact, and the number can be shared. In Europe, there has been a $60 - $65 per ton QoQ improvement in realization, which is higher than guided.

In the first quarter, Tata Steel's cost and net realisation guidance were close to what was guided. For the second quarter, there will be a reduction in realisations in Europe and India, supplemented by lower coking coal consumption prices. Additional costs were incurred due to the cold rolled mill and blast furnaces. Tata Steel has a 50-50 JV with Tata BlueScope for coated products in the building systems market. Assets from the acquisition of Bhushan Steel will be leased to the JV. This arrangement will result in the derecognition of assets and earnings for Tata Steel. The turnover and EBITDA will move to other income. The current other income run rate could continue in the foreseeable future.

Koushik Chatterjee explains that the fair valuation transfer has resulted in the current reflection. However, in the future, there will be lease charges, marginal capital charges, and the margin on leased assets, which will be smaller. 

Regarding the UK government support for Europe, discussions are ongoing and not limited to financial support. Policy support and other enabling support are also being discussed, and a plan for the UK will be announced in the second half of the year.

Tarang Agarwal asks about the environmental and social capex and the absolute level of working capital. Koushik Chatterjee clarifies that the mentioned 23% of capex is for the total portfolio and includes compulsory capex for safety and environmental factors. He also explains that working capital is managed efficiently and fluctuates based on various factors.

When asked about the capitalised expenses in the standalone financials, Koushik Chatterjee explains that assets are capitalised at the end of the year, and some expenses are work in progress while others are capitalised.

In response to a question about the cash flow impact of the £200 million surplus pertaining to BSPS (British Steel Pension Scheme), Koushik Chatterjee states that there is no cash flow impact. The surplus helped with the buy-in, and as it went out, the surplus also went out, resulting in a non-cash deferred tax impact on the profit and loss statement.

Ritesh Shah from Investec asked about a surplus of Rs. 6,600 crores at the end of March and if it could come back to the India balance sheet. Koushik Chatterjee from Tata Steel explained that there is no hope for that because it is a separate entity, but it is a noncash transaction. The surplus is a trigger point for derisking, and there will be a residual that needs to be taken out. There will be no cash flow impact. Ritesh Shah then asked why the word "decisive" was used regarding Tata Steel UK. Koushik Chatterjee explained that the assets are coming to the end of life, and it is important to ensure employee safety and regulatory compliance. Samita Shah added that there would be a corresponding deferred tax charge. The conference then transitioned to chat questions, with the first question about the consolidated EBITDA of Rs. 6,122 crores. Samita Shah explained that they calculate EBITDA by looking at total income and excluding expenses, whereas others exclude other income.

TSLP is benefiting from the strong auto market because they have many products going to auto. TSLP expects a reduction of about Rs. 3,100 per ton in the second quarter for India operations. The conversation with the Netherlands government regarding funding for the decarbonisation project is still ongoing. The details will be shared when they are closer to a conclusion. Positive conversations have been had with the government. The transition will take some time to finalize, and there is work to be done. TSUK imports HRC from Tata Steel India to support operations and comply with quotas. These imports are given as a substrate to the UK downstream and Tata Steel UK sells it to their customers.

Indian steel exports facing competition from China, Japan, Vietnam, and the Middle East. Concern about this. Tata Steel's exports typically 10%-15% of production, last quarter 5%. Chinese exports reached 8 million tons, a cause for concern. Chinese steel producers expected economic recovery, didn't happen. Chinese exports anticipated to decrease to 5-6 million tons. Chinese government discourages exports due to carbon reduction targets. Expect a more balanced second half of the year. Will impact Tata Steel's exports and overall steel prices. Expect hot-rolled coil prices to increase to $600-$650 per ton. Capex plans for FY24: Rs. 16,000 crores, with Rs. 11,000 crores for Kalinganagar. No constraint on supporting Kalinganagar capex. Already spent Rs. 18,000 crores on Kalinganagar project. Will provide more funds as needed. Focus on fast project execution. Expansion plans for NINL, timeline not mentioned.

Tata Steel's first objective for NINL was to bring all facilities back on track and they have achieved that within a year. The coke plant in Neelachal is expected to start production by August. The company is now entering the next phase of detailed engineering and plans to expand to 4-4.5 million tons. They have also secured approvals for this expansion. The iron ore requirements for 2030 are estimated to be around 60-65 million tons and Tata Steel already has reserves of 500-550 million tons beyond 2030. They are developing greenfield mines like Gandhalpada to meet future demand. The company aims for self-sufficiency in iron ore and plans to bid for more mines in Odisha and Jharkhand. In terms of inorganic growth, Tata Steel is focused on achieving growth through organic means and no specific assets are mentioned.

Tata Steel aims for growth using existing sites to minimize costs. Organic growth is the priority but they will monitor inorganic opportunities. Working capital increased by Rs. 2,500 crores due to price changes. Iron ore production will ramp up in line with steel production. Sufficient environmental clearances are in place. The goal is to not buy iron ore from the market. In the next 2-3 years, the Netherlands is expected to be EBITDA and cash flow positive. Historically, the Netherlands' EBITDA per ton ranged from €70 to €140.

Tata Steel has been consistently generating positive free cash flow, averaging about €200 million. In FY22, it generated over €500 million of free cash. Naren mentioned that it has also had positive PAT and free cash flow, not just EBITDA. Their expectation is that this positive performance will continue after relining. The focus now is to ensure it is prepared for the future in terms of cost structure for decarbonisation. The colleagues in the Netherlands are working towards this initiative. The conference is now ending with closing comments from Ms. Samita Shah.
