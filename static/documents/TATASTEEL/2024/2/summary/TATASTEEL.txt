Tata Steel held an analyst call to discuss their second quarter results for FY2024. Participants included the CEO, MD, VP of Corporate Finance, and various analysts. The call began with a reminder that the conversation is covered by the safe harbour clause. The CEO discussed Tata Steel's focus on sustainable value and strategic priorities. He mentioned that steel prices across regions have moderated due to economic slowdown and interest rate increases. In India, steel prices were impacted by global sentiment but declined less compared to other markets. The CEO also shared information on production, deliveries, and sales in India and Europe. He highlighted the growth projects and plans for decarbonization. The CFO will provide more details on the impairment and restructuring costs. Tata Steel has received recognition for its innovative approach to risk management.

Tata Steel had a quarterly revenue of Rs. 55,682 crores and EBITDA of Rs. 4,315 crores. The UK and Netherlands performance was negatively impacted. Tata Steel has received sanctions for the amalgamation of Tata Steel Long Products and Tata Steel Mining with Tata Steel Limited. Standalone EBITDA was Rs. 6,917 crores. Costs have decreased, including coking coal consumption and conversion costs. EBITDA loss in Tata Steel UK was £132 million, while in Tata Steel Netherlands it was £110 million. The completion of BF6 in the third quarter is expected to drive improvements. Tata Steel UK is undergoing discussions and consultation for business restructuring and decarbonization. Impairment charges have been recorded for the UK business. The charge in Tata Steel Standalone is Rs. 12,961 crores and in the consolidated books is about Rs. 3,255 crores.

The investment made in the business affects its value. When there is a deficit, it leads to impairment. Impairment in the consolidated statement reverses the standalone impairment. In the consolidated financial statement, the discounted cash flow of each business is compared to the carrying value of assets. The carrying value of assets in standalone was higher than in the consolidated business, causing the difference.

Taxes dropped sharply this quarter. Current tax was about Rs. 1,105 crores, in line with the profitability of India operations. The deferred tax credit of Rs. 1,333 crores was driven by the merger and completion of the British Steel Pension Scheme. Taxes are expected to normalize post mergers. The deferred tax also includes credits from TSLP and the mining merger. There are other tax adjustments which can be explained offline.

Operating cash flow for the quarter was about Rs. 4,658 crores, driven by favorable working capital movement. In the second quarter, there was a release of working capital due to decreased inventory volumes, steel prices, and debtors. Capital expenditure during the quarter was about Rs. 4,553 crores and Rs. 8,642 crores in the first half. Priority is given to growth in India, including expansion of the downstream portfolio. 

The operating performance at Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK, higher capex, and dividend payout led to a decline in cash equivalent by about Rs. 6,352 crores. Gross debt remained stable, but net debt increased by about Rs. 5,600 crores. Finance costs remained stable. Group liquidity is strong at about Rs. 27,637 crores, including Rs. 12,691 crores of cash and cash equivalents. Moody's upgraded credit rating to investment grade in September 2023.

The first question is about developments in the UK. The restructuring provisions have been made, and discussions with employees are ongoing. The consultation process is following legal requirements and will continue for a few more weeks. It is a sensitive subject and investment process needs to be considered. Engagement with unions and advisors has been detailed.

The business is facing challenges and risks. They are currently in an intense and exhaustive process. They hope to complete it on time. They plan to focus on market protection and a stable supply chain. They expect the volume to be around 2.5 - 2.6 million tons. More details will be discussed in the next earnings call. The losses in Europe are increasing. The blast furnace relining in the Netherlands has been extended. They expect the blast furnace to be up and running by the end of November or the first week of December. They expect better numbers in the next quarter. They plan to mothball the UK existing furnace after consulting. They will run it fully in the third quarter. The sustainability capex outlay for Netherlands is unspecified. They expect similar support from the European governments.

There are two topics discussed in the paragraph. The first topic is about the net cash outflow and timing of cash flows during the transition plan in the UK. The CEO mentions that specific numbers are not provided now, but the ask is 40% to 60% of the required capex for the transition. It is also important to ensure a level playing field with other countries in terms of operational advantages or disadvantages.

The second topic is about the cash outflows. The project cash outflow is around £1.25 billion, with £750 million borne by Tata Steel and £500 million as a grant from the UK government. Spending will start in the second half of FY25 after the completion of the engineering phase. The restructuring cost will be spent in the first half of FY25, and the specifics will be discussed during the consultation phase.

Regarding the Port Talbot capacity, the investment in the downstream will be small compared to the heavy end. The focus will be on license to operate, safety, and maintaining the quality of assets. There won't be significant investments in the current assets.

Tata Steel CEO and MD, T. V. Narendran, expects savings on maintenance opex in the UK. The pellet plant and cold rolling mill in India are already operational. The blast furnace in India will start in the next 6 months. Additional volume will be produced with the second caster in the steel melt shop. Other facilities will also be commissioned next year. The numbers and operating drivers for Europe will be finalized next quarter. Tata Steel has taken a complete writedown of upstream assets in the UK but not in the Netherlands. Once the transition plan is finalized, further assessments will be made.

Netherlands is more profitable than the UK. Netherlands is in a more economically stable transition compared to the UK. Feedback from the government will determine the pacing of the transition. Netherlands has a rich downstream asset portfolio. Cash flow during the transition is expected to be positive. The gross spread in the Netherlands is not enough to cover high fixed costs. The spread at which we operate is around €240 - €250 per ton. The objective of the transition is to be cash neutral or positive and keep downstream units running. The integrated spread is €240 per ton, but the conversion spread from slab in the Netherlands is unknown.

Tata Steel has been experiencing negative EBITDA and NRV losses due to the use of high-cost slabs that were produced last year and kept in stock. These slabs were produced when gas prices were high. This situation is temporary and not a long-term solution. In Europe, the average EBITDA percentage is about 6-8% when using purchased raw materials in an integrated basis, but it falls to around 3% in a conversion model. The coking coal cost in India is expected to increase by $10-11 per ton in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, while in the Netherlands, it is expected to decrease by $60-65 per ton. In the UK, it is anticipated to decrease by $20 per ton. Tata Steel is not benefiting from the higher inventory of coking coal in India operations and is using the coal purchased last quarter. The prices of coking coal were dropping until September and then started increasing. The consumption of higher cost coal affected the reduction in costs. The inventory is flowing through and there is a lag effect.

Ashish Jain from Macquarie asked about a provision in the UK that includes costs related to employees. Koushik Chatterjee from Tata Steel explained that the provision includes costs for impairment and potential obligations from redundancies, closures, and restructuring. Ashish Jain further asked if the provision reflects the employee-related cost. Koushik Chatterjee clarified that the provision includes multiple elements and is a broad bracket of restructuring. Ashish Jain then asked if the fixed costs in the UK would decline once the employee negotiation is over. Koushik Chatterjee mentioned that the cost reduction would be phased over 2-3 quarters based on consultation with unions, with the majority of costs being incurred in the first half of FY2025. Ashish Jain asked if the fixed costs would decline once the one-time outgo happens.

The focus of the restructuring and reinvestment is to run the business without impacting cash flows. The reduction in fixed costs will occur after two quarters and will have a significant effect across the organization. The goal is to ensure that the fixed cost overheads are tightly managed in order to make profits and generate cash flows. In the Netherlands, the realizations were down by €61 per ton and the coking coal cost decreased by $7 per ton. The volume impact between the first and second quarter was a decrease of 100,000 tons in sales. Other costs such as gas prices, energy prices, and repair and maintenance prices were lower. Despite the increase in net debt this quarter, the performance is expected to improve in India and Europe, and it is unclear if the current net debt level is the peak for the year and the next 3-4 quarters.

For the next 2 quarters, net debt should be around the same level assuming the Netherlands rebounds as planned. We want to reduce net debt, but it depends on market conditions and restructuring expenses. Our long-term goal is to reduce net debt. Given the market conditions, net debt should come down from here. There is no cash outflow associated with the BSPS provision. The BSPS step is completed. The blast furnace at Kalinganagar will start and ramp up next year. There is a 3-4 year time frame for the next phase of expansion.

Tata Steel has ongoing projects like Kalinganagar and the Ludhiana EAF project.
They plan to increase capacity to 0.75 MTPA within the next 2 years.
They are finalizing plans for Neelachal expansion and Kalinganagar Phase 3 in the next 6 months.
They have the opportunity to increase Neelachal capacity to 5 million tons and Kalinganagar capacity to 13 million tons.
They are also looking to expand the Bhushan plant, going from 5 to 6.5 million tons in the first phase and 6.5 to 10 million tons in the second phase.
Tata Steel is considering scaling up other EAFs to reach a capacity of 40 MTPA.
They are currently looking at South as the next location for expansion.
Ashish Jain asks if Tata Steel is delaying expansion due to a focus on the balance sheet and if they are at risk of losing market share.
T.V. Narendran explains that they prioritize growth in India, which is value-accretive and cash positive.
They are currently focusing on detailed engineering work to reduce the cash-to-cash cycle in expansion projects.
They confirm that they are on track to reach 40 million tons by 2030.
Ashish Jain asks if NINL will be prioritized for cost optimization, and T.V. Narendran explains that after Kalinganagar, Neelachal expansion will likely be the next phase, followed by Bhushan and Kalinganagar Phase 3.
The conference is handed over to Ms. Samita Shah for chat questions.

Tata Steel Limited is undergoing restructuring, with a consultation process in progress. The restructuring plan has not yet been executed, but it is being proposed and agreed upon with the union. The company has taken provisions for the restructuring. The capex guidance for FY2025 will be discussed in the next call. Priority-wise, completing the Kalinganagar facilities is the main focus. Provisions have also been taken for Tata Steel UK. The company will engage with trade regulatory authorities regarding steel imports in the UK.

Chinese steel imports to India have increased by 1 million tons in the first half of the fiscal year. The government may start an antidumping investigation. Certifications for imported steel are being examined. The bigger concern is Chinese exports worldwide, which is affecting international steel prices. India's domestic market is strong, but globally, stable steel prices depend on China exporting less. If imports continue to rise, the government may take action. The integration of NINL with standalone will happen after a cooling off period. Tax losses of TSLP are being considered in the integration planning. The refinancing of the ABJA bonds is part of deleveraging and will be based on cash flow planning. The goal is to reduce and pay off the bonds in due course of time.

Capex will turn into generation with Kalinganagar Phase 2 expansion. Benefit expected from FY2025, with maximum benefit in FY2026. Debt levels will start decreasing. Sales volume projected at 8.5 million tons for FY2024, closer to 10 million tons for FY2025. KPO-2 blast furnace commissioning timeline to be discussed in the next call. Funding plan for £750 million capex in UK includes equity and debt. No further impairment charges expected. Cash outflow for UK restructuring costs to be determined after consultation process. Realizations in India expected to be Rs. 2,200 per ton higher in 3Q than 2Q. Strong demand in domestic market. Decarbonization project in Netherlands being discussed with government. Capex and configuration to be finalized. Funding and production loss details still under negotiation.

- Broader plan submission to government soon.
- Negotiations for support and funding plan to be discussed.
- Downstream assets strategy for profitable growth.
- Tubes, wires, packaging, and DI pipe businesses are key downstream businesses in India.
- Ambition to double capacity in tubes, wires, and packaging businesses.
- EBITDA margins lower but ROIC tends to be higher in downstream.
- Bond maturities for next year under consideration.
- Preference for onshore financing.
- Managing slab inventory and price risk for TSN and TSUK.

Tata Steel stocked up on slabs because their blast furnace was going down. They don't normally buy slabs. They make as much slabs as they can consume. They might consider selling any extra slabs. They don't buy slabs in the Netherlands or the UK. They will decide what to do in the future based on consultations and transition plans. They aim to run the business in a cash neutral or cash positive way. There has been an excess supply of tinplate in the Indian market. The value addition between hot rolled coil and tinplate has shrunk. Non-prime tinplate imports have caused a supply-demand imbalance. They hope the situation will improve in the future. The call has ended.
