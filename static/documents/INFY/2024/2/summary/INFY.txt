Enclosed are transcripts of the press conference and earnings call after the Board meeting on October 12, 2023. The audio/video recordings are available on the company's website. Infosys Limited held a Q2 FY '24 Earnings Conference Call on October 12, 2023, with participation from CEO Salil Parekh, CFO Nilanjan Roy, and other members of the leadership team. They discussed the company's performance in Q2, including 2.3% quarter-on-quarter growth and a 21.2% operating margin. They also mentioned winning large deals and focusing on cost efficiency and automation.

Infosys has won large and mega deals, setting a strong foundation for the future. The company is facing challenges due to low digital transformation and discretionary spends. They are utilizing Generative AI to increase market share and have trained 57,000 employees in this area. A compensation review program for employees has been announced. They are focusing on margin expansion through various strategies. Rafael Nadal and Iga Świątek have been welcomed as brand ambassadors. Growth guidance for the financial year has been changed to 1% to 2.5% in constant currency. Q2 revenue growth was 2.5% YoY. H1 revenue growth was 3.3% and operating margins were at 21%. The large deal TCV for Q2 was $7.7 bn, with 48% being net new. Project Maximus, a margin improvement plan, has been launched. Operating margins for Q2 were 21.2% and headcount declined by 2.2%. The company is focused on improving operating efficiencies and client metrics remain strong. Compensation hikes for FY '24 are being rolled out. Free cash flow for the quarter was $670 mn. EPS grew by 1.7% in dollar terms and 4.6% in rupee terms. The company had a successful outcome in large deal wins, signing 21 deals in Q2.

Infosys had deals in various sectors such as retail, manufacturing, telecom, FS, life sciences, and EURS. The company signed more deals in America and Europe compared to ROW. The financial services sector faced challenges with slow growth in areas like mortgages, asset management, investment banking, cards, and payments. The communication sector also had growth challenges due to high opex pressures, inflation risk, interest rates, and supply/demand imbalances. Clients in EURS were cautious with discretionary spending. The energy sector focused on cost reduction and ROI due to economic slowdown. Manufacturing showed double-digit growth, thanks to capabilities in digital transformation, cloud ERP, supply chain, and smart factory. The retail segment had tight budgets and focused on cost and efficiency. There was a reduction in growth guidance for FY '24, but strong deal signings and pipelines were expected to lead to future growth. The margin guidance for the year remained at 20% to 22%.s

The speaker mentioned a program over the next 18 months to improve margins. There are questions about revenue one-timers and their impact on margins. The speaker did not disclose which verticals the mega deals belong to. The synchronization of revenue growth and deal wins is discussed, with a mention of a transition period for mega deals. The pipeline for future deals is said to be strong. The profitability dynamics of mega deals are addressed, with no reported margin erosion.

The speaker mentions that they are able to rotate their portfolio and get deals. They also mention cost optimization programs to improve margins. They highlight that $50 billion of large deals have not affected their margins. The next speaker congratulates them on strong TCV bookings but asks when the top line growth will improve. The speaker responds that there are deals in the pipeline and some have already started in Q3. They clarify that these deals are not dependent on the calendar '24 budget. They mention that many of these deals involve cost takeout programs. The final question asks about the calendar '24 budget cycle, to which the speaker responds that client conversations suggest a continued focus on cost and efficiency. There is no indication of a change in mindset at this stage.

During the quarter, the volume performance was under pressure and there was continued constraint on volume. Revenue was impacted by the slowing or stopping of discretionary work and transformation programs. Large and mega deals provided a benefit to revenue. In the coming quarters, there will be the usual seasonal impact in Q3 and Q4. Infosys is working on proprietary language models, both proprietary and open source. The models are used for applications in software development, text, voice, and video. These models are for clients and also used within Infosys. The mega deal wins and robust order book signing will help accelerate growth beyond FY '24. Revenue from these deals will start in FY '25, with some starting sooner in FY '24.

The person thanked the team for the opportunity and asked two questions about discretionary spends and deal activity. The CEO mentioned that they don't have a view on FY '24 and shared information about the pipeline and deal activity. Another person asked about the revenue accretion from large deals and mentioned that it will be minimal this year. The CFO confirmed the assumption and stated that the larger accretion will happen in FY '25. The person then asked about the headwinds on discretionary spending, and the CFO listed financial services, mortgage, asset management, retail, and communication as the affected verticals. The conversation ended with well wishes.

The speaker is asking if there are any specific projects that are not contributing as expected. The response is that there is no one specific project or client causing the issue. They evaluate the combination of discretionary work, digital transformation, and other programs each quarter. Changes in discretionary work, decision-making for closing deals, and start of ramp up all impact the revenue outlook. Certain industries such as financial services, mortgages, asset management, hitech, telco, and parts of retail have been affected. The next question is about the impact of third-party bought-out items on guidance, to which the response is that it is part of their strategy and included in the guidance. There is a question about wage hikes next quarter and the response is that they have already rolled it out. The next question is about the underlying assumption for the guidance, to which the response is that Q3 and Q4 are seasonally weaker quarters.

The company has observed weaker Q3 and Q4 seasons historically.
They have closed four mega deals and have a good pipeline for large deals.
The full benefit of Project Maximus will be seen in fiscal year '25.
They do not disclose the percentage of revenues sourced from discretionary areas.
There have been no cancellations of signed contracts for large deals.
The pricing environment has been mostly stable, with some clients requesting discounts.

Keith Bachman finished speaking. Moderator thanked him and introduced Yogesh Agarwal from HSBC to ask a question. Yogesh Agarwal asked about the share of large deals from existing customers versus new. Salil Parekh answered that they shared the net new amount but not the breakdown between new and existing clients. Yogesh Agarwal then asked if clients were awarding large contracts instead of spending on small discretionary projects, and if this meant there would be catch-up on discretionary spend next year. Salil Parekh explained that these large deals were not a consolidation of smaller projects but rather independent programs focused on cost efficiency. He mentioned that they were gaining market share in this space and saw a good foundation for the future. Vivek Gedda from SBI Mutual Fund then asked about the market share gains from these large deal wins. Salil Parekh explained that discussions on cost or consolidation were more prevalent and that they had a strong capability with automation, leading to market share gains in those areas. However, he did not provide a quantifiable measure.

Client budgets are not increasing at this stage. ACV growth versus TCV growth is not typically shared, but some specific disclosures have been made. There are different items and impacts on margins. Volume decline is supported by stronger growth in the balanced portfolio and improved realization from one-timers. Contribution of less than $50 mn deals is not disclosed. Headcount is expected to improve with utilization increase.

There were no revenue changes mentioned in the call. Apurva's line was muted. No response from current participant. Conference is over. Salil said they had a great quarter with $7.7 billion in large deals. They are focused on margin expansion and investing in Generative AI. The call has ended.
