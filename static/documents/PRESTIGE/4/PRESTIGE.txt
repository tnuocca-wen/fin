The transcript is from the Q1 FY2024 Earnings Conference Call of Prestige Estates Projects Limited that took place on August 9, 2023. The call was hosted by Axis Capital Limited. The call included Mr. Irfan Razack, Chairman & Managing Director, Mr. Venkat Narayana, Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Amit Mor, Chief Financial Officer of Prestige Estates Projects Limited. The moderator welcomed the participants to the call and mentioned that it was being recorded. Mr. Samar Sarda from Axis Capital Limited then took over the call and introduced the management. Mr. Irfan Razack handed over to Mr. Venkat Narayana, who summarized the performance of the company for the quarter. They had a great quarter with total sales of 3915 Crores, collections of 2741 Crores, and significant growth in average realization per square foot. They sold 2276 units, launched Prestige Lavender Fields, and had significant sales contributions from Mumbai. They also had several completion and launch projects, with a robust launch pipeline for the rest of the year.

Prestige Estates Projects has launched several projects in different locations. They are excited about the upcoming launches and expect the rest of the year to be even better. The quarter had a decrease in revenue due to project completion. Revenue is only recognized when the project is completed. Exceptional items related to REIT units contributed to the EBITDA and PAT percentages. Construction spend for the quarter was divided amongst residential, commercial, retail, and hospitality segments. They also invested in new land acquisitions. Collection from the development business was higher than construction expenses.

In August 2023, Prestige Estates Projects Limited had positive net cash flows of 1000 Crores and invested the remaining money in acquisitions. They have seen significant growth in presales, going from 2800 Crores before COVID to 13000 Crores last year. They have invested around 3000 Crores in 5-6 new projects, which will be launched within the next 15 months. These investments will result in great presales numbers this year and next year. The slight increase in debt is due to these acquisitions. The moderator opens the floor for questions. The first question is about the 1300 Crores land investment, asking for a breakdown of where the money was spent. Venkat Narayana explains that it went towards the balance payment for projects in the pipeline, including Prestige Nautilus at Worli, Prestige Ocean Towers at Marine Lines, Prestige Park Grove, two projects at Electronics City, and Bannerghatta Road. Additionally, they invested 175 Crores to consolidate their holding with retail in REIT.

Prestige Estates Projects Limited had investments in the REIT this quarter. They invested more because of a previous agreement. They made a balance payment for convertible instruments and took a small amount compared to their percentage holdings. There was an increase in capex outlay this quarter due to the addition of Mumbai commercial projects. The estimates for total spending are good unless there is a significant cost increase. The Ocean Towers and Nautilus projects are planned to be launched this year. They will be fully launched at once. The total GDV for all the projects this year is around 7000 Crores for Prestige Park Grove, 7000 Crores for Prestige City at Hyderabad, 4500 Crores for Prestige Pallava Gardens at Chennai and Prestige Bougainvillea Gardens in Noida, and 9000 Crores for Ocean Towers and Nautilus. There has been progress with the Bougainvillea Gardens launch in Noida, and they are hoping for sanctions in the next meeting.

Pritesh Sheth thanked the speaker and wished them good luck. The moderator introduced Adhidev Chattopadhyay from ICICI Securities for the next question. Adhidev Chattopadhyay asked about the status and operational timeline of the Delhi Aero City Hotel project. Irfan Razack answered that the scheduled date for the hotel to become operational is 2025. Adhidev Chattopadhyay asked for clarification on whether it is FY2025 or FY2026. Irfan Razack clarified that FY2025 will be for the office, and FY2026 will be for the hotel. Adhidev Chattopadhyay inquired about the possibility of stake buyouts in this and other projects. Irfan Razack explained that stake buyouts depend on a case-by-case basis and if partners are unable to fund, their shares may be diluted. He mentioned that there are currently no discussions about stake buyouts. Adhidev Chattopadhyay's final question was about the debt levels and if they would be revised considering the stake acquisition. Irfan Razack stated that the robust cash flows from the residential business and the minimal debt on the hotel portfolio would help manage the debt. He mentioned that any necessary debt for completing capex projects can be handled by the strong balance sheet. Venkat Narayana added that the debt equity ratio was guided for this quarter, and the sales from the previous year would start contributing. Irfan Razack mentioned that there is around 40 to 50000 Crores worth of unrecognized revenue.

Venkat Narayana says revenue recognition will increase when the topline increases. He also mentions that debt equity will return to its previous state and debt levels will be as guided by FY2024. Adhidev Chattopadhyay asks if their assumption of having a net debt of 7 to 7500 Crores by March 2024 is reasonable. Venkat Narayana agrees but adds that it may still be around 0.5 as guided. The moderator thanks everyone, and Parikshit Kandpal asks about the Mumbai BKC project and its financial closure. Venkat Narayana confirms the financial closure and mentions they will start drawing money soon. Parikshit Kandpal also asks about the progress of the project, and Venkat Narayana confirms that work has started, with excavation being done by the contractor L&T. He mentions that the project will move from upcoming to ongoing by the end of this quarter. Parikshit Kandpal then asks about the Ocean Towers project, specifically why the area share has decreased. Venkat Narayana explains that they bought out the partner in Ocean Towers, and the decrease in area share is due to small differences in the approval process.

The project is happening in Prestige Projects Private Limited. The family office holds 40% of the stake. Prestige Projects Private Limited had 60% from the listed company and 40% was held by HK. HK's stake was bought by the family office three years ago. Our debt has gone up to 6400 Crores and we have a capex of 17000 Crores to be incurred. We may end up with a debt of 15 to 16000 Crores. We need inventory and planning for the next year due to unprecedented growth. Free cash flows that we can generate from the residential business are close to 29000 to 30000 Crores. We can fund one third from residential cash flows and borrow the rest from the bank. Our goal is lease rental discounting and meeting the growth.

The company's debt is at 4000 Crores, primarily from residential debt at 4400 Crores. The rental portfolio is valued at 45000 Crores, which can help support the debt on the capex side. There are options to monetize the rental portfolio and potentially reduce the debt by 5 to 6000 Crores. The company is considering when the ideal time to divest or list in a public platform would be. The assets being built are of high quality and have value creation potential. The timing for unlocking the value needs to be decided based on when the assets are ready or when better value can be obtained. The potential asset value is around $5 billion or 40000 Crores, with a potential unlocking of 7 to 8000 Crores. The right timing for divestment needs to be determined.

Venkat Narayana and Parikshit Kandpal thank Irfan for answering their questions. Runit Kapoor asks about the Mumbai projects in Worli. Worli has a lot of supply coming up, so Runit is concerned about the impact on sales. Nautilus will be purely residential, while Jijamata will have a mix of residential, retail, and hospitality. Jijamata is still a few quarters away. Nautilus is almost ready and expected to receive a good response from the market. In Jijamata, there will be a mix of commercial and residential, including mid-income housing. Jijamata will also have redevelopment and some service offices. Nautilus is ready and will be available in the next couple of quarters. The stake in Jijamata is planned to be ramped up to 26%, while in Nautilus it is currently around 40%.

The listed company, Nautilus, is entirely owned by the group and not by any outsiders. 
Runit Kapoor asked if there are any plans for retail projects like malls in Mumbai. 
Irfan Razack said there is potential for retail projects, but it depends on how the planning goes. 
Runit Kapoor asked if the hotel occupancy has improved this quarter, specifically for JW Marriott Golfshire Hotel. 
Irfan Razack said JW Marriott is a different product with resort pricing and a different positioning. 
Puneet Gulati congratulated the company on their good performance and asked about entering agreements with family ownership and company ownership. 
Venkat Narayana explained the arrangements made for the Prestige city project and mentioned their investments in other projects. 
Puneet Gulati asked if Nautilus is part of a similar structure, and Venkat Narayana confirmed that it is.

Puneet Gulati asked about future business development plans and capital allocation. Venkat Narayana mentioned launching projects in FY2024 and FY2025, with investment of 4 to 5000 Crores per year. Puneet asked about cash flow for Jijamata Nagar, and Venkat confirmed it is included. Puneet asked if there could be more potential in terms of sales, and Venkat said it's possible if they choose to exploit more. Puneet asked about construction costs for 3 million square feet, and Venkat mentioned it is around 1500 Crores. Puneet clarified that their share of cash flow from sales is 5000 Crores and questioned the investment amount. Venkat explained their proportionate spend of around 400 Crores. Puneet asked about potential profitability, and Irfan Razack mentioned they need to spend another 150 to 200 Crores. Puneet commented on it being a good deal and thanked everyone. The meeting concluded.

Kunal asked about the company's spending on JDS and the debt levels. Venkat explained that the current free cash flow is 1000 Crores and the business development outlay is for presales of 20000 Crores. The company expects to generate positive cash flow from the developmental business each quarter. Kunal expressed concerns about the operating cash flow and the company's spending on land and capex. Venkat assured that the company's margins and completed inventory sales would help stabilize the numbers.

Kunal asks about the change in strategy for managing debt levels. Venkat explains that they may become equity partners instead of doing strata. Venkat also mentions the large amount of free cash flows they will generate over the next four years. Kunal asks if these cash flows are pre-tax and pre-overheads. Venkat clarifies that they are factored in after considering all costs. Kunal's last question is about bringing in equity partners. Venkat explains that they should consider the current scale of operations and market growth when comparing debt levels.

Saurabh from JP Morgan asks two questions about a commercial project in Worli. He asks what gives confidence that the project will be successful despite oversupply in the area and the struggles of the exJV partner. He also asks about the finance cost of 109 Crores on the cash flow slide. Irfan Razack says they are confident in the project's success and Venkat Narayana says the development will be sought after. Saurabh asks about the research done to determine the demand for 4 million square foot office space. Irfan Razack corrects him and says it is actually 2 million square feet and explains why there will be demand. Venkat Narayana clarifies that the 109 Crores is the partners' investment. Saurabh asks about the debt in Aero City, which is currently 1250. Atul Tiwari from Citi Group asks the next question.

Atul Tiwari asked about how Prestige is managing debt and ensuring sustainable cash flow. Venkat Narayana explained that debt has increased due to growth and the company is using internal accruals or debt to meet this growth. They are creating valuable assets that will generate higher returns than the borrowing costs. The company has options to reduce debt through partnerships, selling assets, or going public. The money is being invested in projects that will generate growth and free cash flows that outweigh the debt. The current debt on the balance sheet is equal to the ongoing project's free cash flows, but the company also needs to focus on growth.

Moderator says it's the last question. Conference will now be handed over to management. Irfan Razack thanks everyone and says they are confident. Residential is doing well and there is enough demand. Consolidation and delivery give customers confidence. Moderator concludes the conference and thanks everyone. It's time to disconnect.
