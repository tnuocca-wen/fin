Saurabh congratulates DLF for achieving positive net cash. He asks about the pricing of Camellias and the company's cash flow. He also questions the logic of keeping debt and cash on the balance sheet. Saurabh asks Mr. Khattar about marketing space availability. Aakash confirms that Camellias pricing has gone above INR75,000 and mentions the solid demand for the luxury product. Camellias has become a benchmark in the real estate industry.

Vivek Anand discussed the construction spend, which was around INR1,200 crores last year. In the first half of this year, they spent INR650 crores, and it is estimated that they will spend around INR1,000 crores in the second half. On an annualized basis, they expect to spend INR1,700 crores. The second half will see increased spending due to possessions being given and the Arbour project picking up pace. They achieved cash flow from operations of INR2,000 crores in the first half and expect an upside for the full year. They currently have a gross debt of INR3,000 crores, as the available cash is only INR450 crores. They plan to repay the debt with future generated free cash. Sriram Khattar mentioned that there is about 6-7 lakh square feet of space available, with potential release of additional space through hard options. They have upcoming projects like Downtown 4 and Atrium Place, which are being marketed by the leasing and operations teams. Construction of Phase 2 in Taramani and Downtown in Gurgaon is also starting soon.

Saurabh asked about the concern regarding the sharp price rise in Gurgaon. Aakash replied that prices are going up in various sectors, not just in real estate. He mentioned that there is a demand for better and bigger homes, resulting in increased prices. A lot of people, including younger individuals, are now prioritizing buying residential real estate. Aakash believes that the rise in prices reflects a changing mindset and not speculative behavior. He mentioned that rentals and habitation charts indicate a strong demand for housing. Despite this, he acknowledged that things may settle down in the future. Overall, Aakash is optimistic about the number of people wanting to improve their experiences and purchase homes.

Kunal Tayal asks two questions. The first is about future launches and planning for the next phase. The second is about stable tenants in the IT services sector. Aakash Ohri explains their planning process and Ashok Kumar Tyagi assures that there will be a constant stream of projects. Sriram Khattar explains the impact of COVID on IT services companies and their changing workspace requirements. He also mentions that companies are still working on their hybrid models. However, there are green shoots as some companies have started planning for the future.

Puneet Gulati asks about the fall in GAVs in DLF 5 and City Center. Ashok Kumar Tyagi explains that the GAVs have been adjusted based on thorough analysis of building rentals. Puneet Gulati expresses concern about the 20% fall. Ashok Kumar Tyagi suggests that the previous numbers may have been optimistic and the new numbers have been calculated scientifically. Puneet Gulati asks about the small dividend from DCCDL. Ashok Kumar Tyagi explains that DCCDL gave a hefty dividend in Q4 and a half year dividend in Q2. Puneet Gulati asks about the low cash tax liability for DevCo and how long the advantage will persist.

The numbers for the project may change, and there is potential for an upside. The approval process for Sector 76 and Phase 5 is on track for Q4, and Valley Orchard in Panchkula and SCO in Gurgaon are also meeting their timelines.

During the meeting, Mr. Khattar mentioned that the demand for non-SEZ spaces is coming from both new tenants and existing tenants. The majority of the demand is from global capability centers that see India as an attractive location due to its digital infrastructure and skilled workforce. In terms of rentals, they have established INR150 in Downtown Gurgaon and INR100 in Downtown Chennai. In the SEZ space, they have a vacancy rate of about 14%-15%, but they expect demand to increase once floor-wide de-notification is allowed by the ministry of commerce. This could also provide additional stock of about 800,000 to 1 million square feet. When asked about SEZ demand, Mr. Khattar mentioned that it is a combination of existing tenants expanding and new tenants coming in. Regarding Camellias, the pricing assumption is based on different segments, with higher floors having higher prices and preference for location affecting valuations.

DLF Limited's valuation depends on the location and type of floor. The current inventory value is based on Q2 average price realization. The price is expected to increase. Privana project includes high-rise and mid-rise towers. The demand is high, and the product has been enhanced. The FSI utilization for the site is flexible. The product changes are driven by the success of Arbour and customer preferences. The current product is similar to Arbour and not the old colony sector.

Aakash Ohri mentioned that there is a lot to do at DLF 6 and they will build it from scratch. Abhinav Sinha congratulated Mr. Khattar on the company's strong performance and asked about the REIT offering. Ashok Kumar Tyagi explained that the company is ready to proceed with the REIT, but they are not in a hurry. They are waiting for the right time when the interest rate scenario turns favorable. Saurabh Kumar asked about the decrease in staff cost and the completion of Dwarka Expressway. Tyagi responded that they have maintained a sales guidance of INR12,000 - INR13,000 crores, with a potential upside risk.

The staff cost for the full year is expected to be around INR560-570 crores. Quarter 1 had a larger provision for sales incentive, while quarter 2 had sales incentive booked for INR2,000 crores. The gross margins for the Camellias sales will be north of 70%, while the reported gross margin is 57%. The margin for the higher-priced sales will be recognized later. Dwarka Expressway has inventory that has been hanging around for over 5 years, mostly with investors. It is too early to comment on its impact on other developments. DLF projects work on different parameters and requirements, and DLF focuses on end-users rather than speculators. There are two different markets here.

Aakash Ohri mentions that DLF 5 is now comparable to areas like Central Delhi and South Delhi. The development has received accolades and is considered the Beverly Hills of India. The community in DLF 5 contributes significantly to India's GDP and people love staying there. Expats and relocated companies prefer DLF 5 as their first choice for living. The demand for DLF 5 is expected to increase, with prices already rising compared to previous years. The community's green space and security system are attractive features. DLF is focused on launching projects with good margins and is confident about the readiness of their pipelines.

Saurabh Kumar thanks everyone and wishes them a Happy Diwali. The moderator concludes the Q&A session. Ashok Tyagi gives closing comments. He mentions the importance of reaching zero debt, the positive outlook for the future, and the success of RentCo. He hopes the markets remain positive and looks forward to the next quarterly interaction. The moderator thanks everyone and ends the conference.
