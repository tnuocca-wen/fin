The new office developments have received a pre-leasing rate of 89% for the DLF Downtown complexes. The retail business is growing and a new retail complex in Gurugram is expected to start construction. The U.S. Green Building Council recognized DLF's sustainability achievements at a conference in Washington, D.C., and recognized the business as a world leader in LEED certifications. DLF believes its pipeline of new products and rental portfolio will lead to consistent and profitable growth. Sriram Khattar shared that DCCDL and DLF were recognized as world leaders in sustainability by the U.S. Green Business Council. They praised DLF's achievements in LEED certifications and set a standard for others. DLF also achieved LEED zero for waste certification for their Cyber City project in Hyderabad. The Q&A session is now open.

DLF Limited achieved positive net cash after 7 years.
Saurabh Kumar congratulated Team DLF.
Saurabh Kumar had questions about Camellias and cash flow.
Camellias pricing has exceeded INR70,000-75,000 crores.
Construction spend may increase to INR2,000-2,500 crores a year.
Question about keeping INR3,000 crores debt and INR3,200 crores cash on balance sheet.
Marketing space in non-SEZ area is not available, thoughts on getting that space.
Aakash Ohri confirmed Camellias pricing is above INR75,000 crores.
Solid demand backs the pricing.
Camellias is now the benchmark for super luxury products in India.
Reaching INR100 crore mark is a big satisfaction for DLF Limited.

Vivek Anand discussed last year's construction spend, totaling INR1,200 crores. First half spend was INR650 crores and second half spend is estimated to be close to INR1,000 crores, making the annual spend around INR1,700 crores. Second half will see increased spending due to possessions and the Arbour project. Cash flow from operations in the first half was INR2,000 crores, exceeding the guidance of INR3,000 crores annually. Gross debt of INR3,000 crores will be maintained until free cash is generated. Sriram Khattar mentioned that there is 3-3.5% space available, around 6-7 lakh square feet, with additional options to be released at market rates. Plans include completing Downtown 4 in Gurgaon by the end of '24 and starting Atrium Place in '25. Phase 2 construction in Taramani and Downtown in Gurgaon will also begin soon.

Saurabh asks about concerns regarding the sharp price rise in Gurgaon. Aakash says that prices going up indicates demand for better and luxury products. The demand for better, bigger homes is high, making residential real estate purchases a priority. Aakash believes that the rise in prices reflects a changing mindset among buyers. He also mentions that rental rates and habitation charts show positive trends. Aakash is optimistic and sees a lot of people, including first-time buyers, wanting to improve their experiences in real estate.

Kunal Tayal asked two questions. The first question was about planning for future launches. Aakash Ohri explained that they plan three years in advance for new launches. Ashok Kumar Tyagi added that their planning process is ongoing and they have enough land for future projects. 
The second question was about IT services tenants. Sriram Khattar mentioned that during COVID, there were more exits but now the hiring is good. Companies are looking for more collaborative spaces and the demand for larger spaces has increased. However, companies are still working on their hybrid models and deciding the form and shape of the hybrid work environment. IT services companies are starting to plan for the future and look for more spaces. The demand for IT services is expected to increase if the return to office works positively. The issue of vacancy will be more subdued in the future.

DLF 5 and City Center's GAVs have fallen quarter-on-quarter. The GAVs were adjusted based on thorough rental analysis. The earlier number may have been optimistic. DCCDL gave a small dividend this time because a hefty dividend was given in Q4. DCCDL gives two dividends a year. The cash tax liability for DevCo is low, but it is uncertain how long this advantage will last.

Ashok Kumar Tyagi mentioned the cash tax liability. Puneet Gulati stated that it is linked to the change in accounting policy due to new accounting standards. They don't anticipate a significant tax liability for the next couple of years. Vivek Anand agreed with this. Puneet Gulati also asked about the sustainable collection run rate, which Vivek Anand confirmed to be good. They discussed the increase in construction cost by 50% from the previous year. Kunal Lakhan asked about the upward revision of prices for Phase 5, and Aakash Ohri mentioned a significant upside in valuation but didn't speculate on future values. Overall, there is a positive outlook.

DLF Limited plans to launch their super luxury project in a staggered manner with varying price points. The numbers provided earlier may change as the product and pricing get finalized closer to the launch. The approval processes for Sector 76 and Phase 5 are on track for Q4. Panchkula will be launched in Q3, while DLF 5 may be launched in either Q4 or Q1 depending on the planning. The exact timeline will be decided closer to Q4 or in January.

DLF sales guidance of 13,000+ is secure, even if projects are delayed.
Kunal asks about utilization of free cash flow.
Vivek explains the priority is generating free cash, repay debt, invest for growth, and reward shareholders.
Parikshit asks about Tulsiwadi and Andheri projects.
Andheri project is on track, expected launch before June 2024.
Tulsiwadi project faces legal issues due to non-transparent process.
DLF and Shapoorji Pallonji are exploring legal options to restore shareholding and protect outstanding debt.
Delhi High Court supports DLF's stand, legal battle ongoing.
Andheri project progressing as planned.

The moderator thanks the speaker and introduces the next question from Pritesh Sheth. Sheth asks about the leasing of 3 lakh square feet in both SEZ and non-SEZ spaces and where the demand is coming from. Khattar explains that the demand is from both new and existing tenants, particularly from global capability centers that see India as an attractive location due to digital infrastructure, cost-effective office spaces, and skilled manpower. In downtown Gurgaon, the rental rate is INR150, while in downtown Chennai it is INR100. Khattar also mentions that in the SEZ space, there is a vacancy of about 14%-15% and expects demand to increase once floor-wide de-notification is allowed. Sheth follows up by asking if the demand in SEZ space is from new tenants or existing tenants expanding, to which Khattar responds that it is a combination of both. Sheth then asks about the pricing assumption for the Camellias inventory, as there has been a 20% increase in inventory value. Ohri explains that pricing varies based on floor levels, with higher floors having higher prices and a 20% difference between the three segments.

Based on the valuation of different floors, the range of prices will vary. The current inventory value is based on the average price of quarter 2. However, the current price is expected to be higher, indicating potential upside in pricing. The product in Privana has already included high-rise towers in addition to mid-rise buildings. The demand is high and the product has been enhanced. There is flexibility in utilizing the maximum FSI available on the site. The changes in the product are driven by the success of Arbour and customer preferences. The site is part of a larger land parcel, so there is no risk of losing FSI if building is delayed. The current product is similar to Arbour and closer to the old colony sector.

Aakash Ohri mentioned that there is a lot to do in DLF 6 as it is a good parcel and will be built from scratch. Abhinav Sinha congratulated Mr. Khattar on the strong performance and asked if this brings them closer to the REIT offering. Ashok Kumar Tyagi explained that the performance of other REITs will bring them closer to a REIT, and they are now ready to press the button within 180 days. He also mentioned that there are still factors delaying the interest rate scenario. However, at some stage, monetization will happen. Saurabh Kumar asked about the decrease in staff cost, completion of Dwarka Expressway, and the sales guidance. Ashok Kumar Tyagi explained that the sales guidance has increased and there is an upside risk to the numbers.

Vivek Anand expects staff costs for the full year to be around INR560 crores to INR570 crores. Quarter 1 had a larger provision for sales incentive, while quarter 2 had sales incentive booked for INR2,000 crores of sales from quarter 1. The gross margins for the Camellias sales will be north of 70%, higher than the reported 57% gross margin. The margin for the sales made during the quarter is 57%. The Dwarka Expressway has inventory that has been hanging around for over 5 years, and it is more of an investor market. It is too early to comment on whether it is conflicting with other developments. DLF projects work on different parameters and requirements, and DLF focuses on end users rather than speculators. There are two very different markets here.

Saurabh asks Aakash about Phase 5 and its relation to other areas like Gurgaon and South Delhi. Aakash says Phase 5 is different and has its own unique features. It is highly regarded and compared to Beverly Hills. The community in Phase 5 contributes significantly to India's GDP and people love living there. Expats and relocated companies also prefer Phase 5. Aakash expects the demand and prices to increase. He sees Phase 5 as a go-to place and a full product now. Aakash mentions the demand for green spaces and security. He also talks about the readiness of DLF pipelines and the importance of margins.

Saurabh Kumar thanked everyone for Diwali. The moderator ended the question-and-answer session. Ashok Tyagi spoke about reaching the goal of zero debt and the positive outlook for the future. The RentCo is doing a great job with leasing and certifications. The conference concluded and participants were thanked for joining.
