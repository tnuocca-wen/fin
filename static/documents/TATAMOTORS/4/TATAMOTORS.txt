BSE Limited has provided a transcript of their earnings discussion/conference call for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2023. The transcript is available on the company's website. Tata Motors Limited held an earnings call on November 2, 2023, where various executives discussed the results. The call included presentations and a Q&A session. The company reported overall revenues of ~Rs. 1,05,000 crores for the quarter and mentioned positive developments in CNGs and e-Buses. They also discussed their tax costs and free cash flows. Additionally, they highlighted corporate actions, including a pre-IPO deal with Tata Technologies and the progress of their IPO.

Tata Motors acquired a 27% stake in Freight Tiger, a digital software solution for freight management. This acquisition fits well with their digital plan for the CV business. They have invested Rs. 150 crores and will invest another Rs. 100 crores in the next few years. They have already become a 26.79% owner and have the right to buy the other investors at fair market value. They also announced a transaction where AVINYA, their premium pure electric vehicle series, will be developed on JLR's EMA platform. This transaction helps Tata Motors enter the high-end segment, reduces development costs, and accelerates the adoption of advanced technologies. It is a global product, not just for India.

JLR delivered strong financial and operational results in Q2. Revenue increased by 30% to GBP 6.9 billion, a new record. EBIT was down at 7.3% for the quarter, but H1 EBIT was 8%. PBT in the quarter was GBP 442 million with GBP 300 million of free cash flow. The first half of the year saw a record revenue of GBP 13.8 billion and GBP 72,000 per car. Wholesale performance was up 4% in the quarter and 29% for the half, with Range Rover and Defender driving the volume increase. China remains a tough market, but other regions performed well. PHEV and BEV percentage went from 12.7% to 13%. PBT increased by GBP 615 million, mainly due to volume and mix. Pricing and material costs were positive, while variable marketing expense increased slightly.

Tata Motors had a positive year in terms of material costs and foreign exchange. Their profit before tax (PBT) improved by GBP 615 million compared to the previous year. Their cash profit after tax has consistently been around GBP 1.1 billion in the last three quarters. They also invested GBP 775 million, mostly in engineering. The investment capitalization ratio fluctuates depending on product lifecycle. Tata Motors expects their wholesale deliveries to continue improving. While supply constraints still exist, they are different from semiconductor constraints and are considered more normal challenges in the industry.

Tata Motors expects an improvement in wholesale volumes and production in Q3 and Q4. Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender make up 77% of their current order bank. They have managed to keep the production of these vehicles constant quarter over quarter. They are also planning to increase production with the addition of a new body shop for MLA. Operationally and financially, Tata Motors is performing well and setting records. They expect their volumes to recover and inflation to moderate. Their guidance for EBIT has changed from 6% plus to around 8%. They have halved their net debt in the past year and aim to reduce it further by the end of the financial year. They will focus on flawless execution of their plans. In the commercial vehicles segment, Tata Motors has seen an improvement in market share, particularly in the heavies and ILMCV sections. However, they face challenges in the small commercial vehicles segment. They are working on pivoting the business to a B2C thinking. The pivot to quality has resulted in increased revenue and EBITDA. They have delivered a double-digit EBITDA both for the quarter and on a half-year basis.

Tata Motors generated Rs. 1,500 crores this quarter and Rs. 2,500 crores for the year. Profitability is good. Monies came from volume mix and realization increase. Market shares increased in key sections. Girish spoke about business growth. Volumes grew 21% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year. Market share improved in M&HCV and passenger segments. Small commercial vehicles and pickups need improvement. Non-vehicle business revenue grew by 20%. Trucks and passenger carriers grew. Customer sentiment improved. Commodity prices softened, improving margins. Cost reduction efforts and realization improvement helped margins. BS6 Phase II products received positive response. Price increase taken due to potential commodity headwinds. Focus on Vahaan share and SCV portfolio. EV supplies scaling up.

Tata Motors has seen growth in spares and service revenue. They have maintained market shares and improved margins in international markets. They have received certification for their Ace EV, the first commercial electric vehicle to do so. The retail numbers for Ace EV are increasing and they are working on finance availability and charging infrastructure. They have deployed 500 electric buses and have had successful contracts in Jammu and Kashmir. They are focusing on processes and IT enablement. They have engaged with the government to address payment security mechanisms in tenders. They have a strong digital platform for logistics and truck operations. Their online marketplace for spare parts, E-Dukaan, has seen significant growth. This has helped improve customer penetration.

Tata Motors had positive retail performance with almost 17% volume coming from digital leads. PV domestic market share was at 13.4% for the quarter. October showed improvement and reached 14%+. EV makes up 13% of the total portfolio. Despite a decline in EV volumes due to product changes, year-on-year performance is good. Revenues decreased by 3%, but EBITDA increased by 110 bps, EBIT by 140 bps, and PBT by Rs. 300 crores for the quarter. PV/EV numbers and the impact on profitability were discussed. PV business reached a double-digit EBITDA of 9.2%. The EV business is growing, but currently shows an EBITDA loss of 5% or Rs.100 crore.

Tata Motors is in control of their numbers and in an affordability zone. Rs. 100 crores of product development expenses have been charged off. EBITDA is expected to increase with lower battery prices and new contracts. No PLI benefits have been considered. The business is well positioned for growth, profitability increase, and market share in the second half of the year. In Q2, wholesale only grew by 5%, but there is a shift towards SUVs with a 50% plus share. Tata Motors' PV and EV business is trending number two in the hatch segment with 48,000 units sold in Q2. Quarter three is expected to have sustained momentum with strong retail demand. Supply concerns, particularly regarding semiconductors, are easing out. Tata Motors has launched new iCNG versions and the Nexon and Nexon EV, which have been well received. The waiting period for these vehicles is now 3 to 4 months. The Harrier and Safari facelifts have also been launched and are expected to do well. The industry faces challenges with high levels of channel inventory.

Tata Motors expects inventory to reach normal levels as demand outlook improves. Regulatory support for EVs has reduced in some markets, such as Telangana. SUVs are gaining popularity while hatches and sedans are declining. The company plans to increase supply for new launches to drive volume growth. They have taken targeted actions to sustain volumes in hatches and sedans, leveraging their multi-powertrain strategy in specific markets. Cash profits are higher than enhanced Capex, indicating the business is well-funded. Investment spending is on track, supporting product plans. TMF business is improving with improving efficiency and reduced GNPA. ROE is increasing, and business diversification is expanding. Demand remains optimistic despite external challenges, and moderate inflation is expected. H2 performance is likely to improve due to seasonality, improved supplies, and new launches. The company aims to sustain an 8% deleveraging rate in JLR.

Tata Motors has a focus on sustaining improvements in market shares for CV and SCV. They will continue their growth and quality strategy, aiming for double-digit EBITDA for the year. They also aim to achieve market-beating growth in the PV sector and increase EV penetration in their portfolio. During the meeting, there were 17 questions lined up, with the first one about EBIT margins and free cash flow guidance. Richard Molyneux explained that their investment levels affect the difference between EBIT and cash flow. They aim to reduce their debt by £1.25 billion in the next six months. Another question addressed the decline in average selling prices, but they don't expect it to continue as constraints are resolved. They also mentioned having an unrecognized deferred tax asset of about £1 billion. The tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 29% in the long term. Girish discussed pricing discipline and the challenges in the LCV industry in India. They also mentioned the order book size and trends in new order intake for ACE EV.

Tata Motors is maintaining pricing discipline. Light commercial vehicles are not growing due to increased prices and cautious financing environment. However, the quality of financiers' books is improving. The company believes in the growth potential of this segment once economics balance out. Tata Motors has received the PLI certificate for ACE EV and continues to deploy vehicles for customers. Retail segments are also showing good traction for ACE EV. Range anxiety, charging infrastructure, and financing environment remain customer concerns, but the company is addressing them. They are developing multiple variants of ACE EV to meet different requirements. The PLI monies are still pending but expected in Q4. JLR's order book rundown pace and other comments will be addressed by Adrian.

- Tata Motors has been consistently reducing its order book by around 5000 units per month for the past nine months.
- They plan to build more cars in the second half of the year to fulfill existing orders and bring the order book back to pre-pandemic levels of 110,000 units.
- Balaji asks Richard if they expect input procurement costs to go up due to higher wage hikes in suppliers like IAC.
- Richard says they are seeing some areas of inflation but overall, they are spending less on broker buys of chips and experiencing reductions in material and operational costs.
- Balaji asks Shailesh and Girish about the outlook for M&HCV and PV growth for FY 2025.
- Girish expects continued growth for M&HCV in Q3 and flat or slight growth in Q4. He says it's too early to comment on FY 2025 due to upcoming general elections.
- Shailesh says it's also too early to comment on PV growth but expects demand to remain strong, although likely in single digits in FY 2025.
- Balaji responds to a question about royalties by saying they are reasonable and at an arm's length basis.
- Girish explains that most of the 7800 chargers deployed are fast chargers located on highways, and 90% of customers charge their cars at home.
- Richard confirms that they will wind down production of current Jaguar cars as they transition to a new fully electric Jaguar.
- The timing of ending production for each vehicle will vary by plant.

Tata Motors is launching an all-electric Jaguar, which is expected to be profitable. 
Shailesh Chandra discusses the growth of EVs in India, citing a 107% growth in H1. 
There was a decline in Q2 due to multiple launches and a decrease in Nexon EV volumes. 
The removal of road tax waiver in Telangana also impacted demand. 
Chandra sees opportunities in expanding EV sales to more cities and introducing new EV models at different price points.

Tata Motors expects the growth of EVs to increase significantly due to three main factors: increasing volumes, improving charging infrastructure, and comfort for customers driving on highways. Oil marketing companies have government subsidies to install chargers on highways, which will attract mainstream buyers. Tata Motors is partnering with JLR on the EMA platform for their AVINYA range of products. This collaboration allows Tata Motors to access advanced features, benefit from cost synergies, and reduce development time for their premium electric SUV.

Tata Motors discussed the collaboration between JLR and the Tata group, which has been growing for four years. The progress made in the last six to twelve months is promising. The company's guidance for a 10% EBIT margin by FY 2026 remains unchanged. Tata Motors has been gaining market share in the M&HCV segment by improving the value proposition for customers through product enhancements, TCO reduction, and improved service offerings. Fleet edge has also become a differentiating factor. The festive sales for PV have been strong, with a 30% growth in registrations and a 16% growth in deliveries during Navaratra. The new Nexon has received a strong response, with a waiting period of three to four months and increased booking rates for EVs.

Shailesh Chandra mentioned four key factors contributing to the improvement in EV margins: cell cost reduction, non-cell cost reduction through localization, use of new generation and compact aggregates, and a cost reduction program for donor vehicles. Balaji asked Girish Wagh about the magnitude of the price hikes announced in October and the raw material environment. Girish stated that there hadn't been any price increase for over 12 months despite inflationary commodity prices, but they have now implemented a price increase and will gradually pass it on. He also mentioned potential headwinds in the steel market. Adrian and Richard were asked about the global market slowdown and EV penetration, but their response was not included in the given paragraph.

Tata Motors is facing a slowdown in some markets. Discounting is happening due to high supplies compared to natural demand. Interest rates are high and incentive deals are supporting those rates. Tata Motors has a strong position in the marketplace with pent-up demand. They plan to increase incentives and stay ahead of the difficulties in the market. In terms of the PV business, production has been affected in the last two months due to ramp up and ramp down of certain models. Curvv and Sierra will be launched in 2024 and 2025 respectively, and the Sanand plant will start production in the first half of 2024.

P.B. Balaji asked about the transaction valuation, burn rate, and funding needed for Freight Tiger in the next few years. They paid Rs.150 crores for a 26% stake, valuing the business at approximately Rs. 420 crores. They estimate a cash burn of around Rs. 100 crores over the next two to three years. Shailesh Chandra mentioned that some models in Tata Motors' portfolio saw a depletion of the order book during the festive period, but it was balanced out by new launches. They expect strong PV volume run rates in the second half. Auto PLI is expected to bring in cash in Q4. JLR's working capital cycle is expected to reverse in the second half of the year. The battery plants in the UK and India are on schedule. There are no plans for fundraising for the EV arm, as they have secured Rs. 7500 Crore from TPG and are well-funded through PLI. The PLI benefit includes meeting threshold and target Capex requirements, 50% localization, and a 13% to 18% benefit on EV sales. The Tiago has ARAI certification confirming 50% localization compliance.

Tata Motors has not included the Nexon in the ACV EV process because it is a new product just launched. Once the approval process for the Nexon is complete, other new brands will also be included. Meeting the DVA requirement is necessary to be eligible for PLI, which requires certification from the statutory auditor and approval from IFC. Supplier claims are offset against the company. The Sanand plant acquisition costs are already accounted for in the P&L and the volumes are picking up. The absence of a secondhand EV market is not the biggest impediment to EV growth, but it is still an important aspect to consider. The market for EVs will be assessed once supply increases.

Tata Motors wants to sell cars at a lower price and provide benefits like lower operating and maintenance costs. They want to transfer the warranty to the next buyer when customers sell their cars. However, the company doesn't have cars in inventory because they were launched only three years ago. P.B. Balaji says they have finished answering questions and appreciate the opportunity. They are available for further questions offline through the investor relations team. They thank the JLR team and everyone present and say goodbye.
