Tata Motors acquired a 27% stake in Freight Tiger, a company that provides digital freight management solutions. The investment will result in lower freight costs for shippers and better transparency and faster payments for truck operators. Tata Motors has already invested Rs. 150 crores and plans to invest an additional Rs. 100 crores in the next few years. The company also announced a collaboration with JLR to develop a premium pure electric vehicle series called AVINYA. This partnership will accelerate Tata Motors' entry into the high-end market and reduce development costs. The product will be launched globally. These are the key actions discussed in the meeting.

JLR is delivering strong financial and operational performance.
In Q2, revenue increased by 30% to GBP 6.9 billion, a record.
EBIT for the quarter was down at 7.3%, but looking at H1, it was at 8%.
PBT in the quarter was GBP 442 million and free cash flow was GBP 300 million.
For the first half of the year, revenue reached GBP 13.8 billion, also a record.
Per unit, revenue was at GBP 72,000 per car.
Wholesale performance increased by 4% in the quarter and 29% for the half.
Range Rover sales were flat, while Defender and Jaguar sales increased.
China's market is tough, but JLR is showing resilience there.
Every region performed better in the first half compared to the previous year.
The percentage of electrified vehicles remained relatively flat in the quarter.
PBT increased by GBP 615 million compared to the previous year.
Volume and mix were positive factors, with Defender and Range Rover Sport performing well.
Pricing has increased slightly, but still strong in the luxury market.
Material costs were favorable compared to the previous year.

Tata Motors had positive improvements in material costs and favorable foreign exchange rates. Despite spending on marketing expenses, the company's profit before tax (PBT) has improved by GBP 615 million compared to the same quarter last year. The cash profit after tax has consistently been around GBP 1.1 billion for the past three quarters. The company also invested GBP 775 million, primarily in engineering, with a capitalization ratio that varies based on product lifecycles. The company expects the investment level to increase in the next couple of quarters and then decrease. Tata Motors is improving its wholesale history and expects to further increase deliveries in the next few quarters. The company still faces supply constraints but they are not solely related to semiconductor chips.

Tata Motors expects improvement in Q3 and Q4 volumes and production. Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender make up 77% of their order bank. Production of these vehicles is crucial. They have managed to keep production constant quarter over quarter. They expect production to improve with the addition of a new body shop. Tata Motors is performing well operationally and financially, setting records and expecting more. They have reduced net debt by half in 12 months and aim to decrease it to less than GBP 1 billion by the end of the year. They will focus on executing their plans flawlessly. In commercial vehicles, there has been a sequential improvement in market share, particularly in heavies and ILMCV sections. However, there is a challenge in small commercial vehicles that they are working on. The pivot to quality has yielded positive results with increased revenue and EBITDA. They have achieved double-digit EBITDA on a half-year basis.

Tata Motors generated Rs. 1,500 crores this quarter and Rs. 2,500 crores for the year so far. Profitability is good. Monies came from volume mix and realization increase. Market shares in key sections are growing, but work still needs to be done in smalls. Girish Wagh mentions good growth in volumes and market share in certain segments. Non-vehicle business revenue grew by 20%. Truck and passenger carrier sales grew. Cost reduction efforts and improvements in realization helped margins. Introduction of BS6 Phase II products has been successful. Price increase to offset commodity headwinds. Focus on SCV portfolio and EV supplies.

Tata Motors has seen growth in spares and service revenue.
Their market shares in international markets remain stable.
They have 1600 Ace electric vehicles on the road, with good experience and PLI certification.
They have deployed 500 electric buses and have high uptime.
They are focused on laying a foundation for a strong business.
They have ISO certificates for some depots and are engaged with the government for new tenders.
They have a strong digital presence with Freight Tiger and Fleet Edge platforms.
Their online marketplace for spare parts, E-Dukaan, has grown 4 times in Q2 of FY 2023.

Tata Motors' retail sales are healthy, with 17% of volumes coming from digital leads.
On the PV side, Vahaan's domestic market share is 13.4% for the quarter.
The EV portion of the total portfolio is 13%.
Overall EV volumes declined sequentially but are still growing year on year.
Revenues went down 3%, but EBITDA is up 110 bps at 6.5%.
EBIT is at 1.8%.
PBT for the quarter is around Rs. 300 crores and Rs. 500 crores for the year.
The PV business is becoming more profitable, with an EBITDA of 9.2%.
The EV business is growing and nearing double-digit EBITDA.
There is a loss of minus 5% or Rs. 100 crore in the EV business.

Tata Motors had control over its numbers and remained affordable. The company's EBITDA is expected to increase in Q3 and Q4 due to lower battery prices and new contracts. The business is well positioned for growth, profitability, and market share in the second half of the year with new product launches. In Q2, the industry saw a single-digit growth in wholesale, with SUVs gaining a 50% plus market share. Tata Motors saw sequential margin growth and became number two in the hatch segment. The company launched several products with twin cylinder technology, which received positive feedback. The launch of the Nexon and Nexon EV helped reduce waiting periods. The Harrier and Safari facelifts have strong bookings and are expected to perform well. The industry faced challenges of high channel inventory, but a strong festive season was anticipated.

Tata Motors expects inventory levels to return to normal as demand outlook improves. They are experiencing a shift in demand from hatches and sedans to SUVs, so they plan to increase the supply for new SUV launches. They are also taking targeted actions to sustain volumes in hatches and sedans. Cash profits are higher than enhanced Capex, indicating the business is living within its means. Investment spending is on track, ensuring well-funded product plans. The TMF business is gradually recovering with improving efficiency and reduced GNPA. The outlook for demand remains optimistic despite external challenges, with H2 performance expected to improve due to seasonality and new launches. JLR is likely to achieve around 8% leverage this year.

Tata Motors Limited is focused on improving market shares in the SCV and M&HCV markets. They aim to achieve double-digit EBITDA and market-beating growth in the PV segment. They are also focused on expanding the market and increasing the EV penetration in their portfolio. During the Q&A session, one question was about the increase in EBIT margins but no change in free cash flow guidance. Richard Molyneux explained that investment levels were causing a disconnect between EBIT and cash flow, but they are on track to reducing their debt. Another question was about the declining average selling prices (ASPs) and the expectation of ASPs increasing as constraints decrease. There was also a question about deferred tax assets and the unresolved issue of bringing it back onto the balance sheet. The tax rate for the company is expected to be between 25% and 29%. In India, there were questions about pricing discipline in the M&HCV sector and the current situation of the LCV industry, as well as the order book size and new order intake for ACE EV.

Tata Motors has maintained pricing discipline without any drops. The light commercial vehicles segment has not seen much growth due to increased prices compared to freight rates and cautious financiers. However, Tata Motors believes in the growth potential of this segment. They have received the PLI certificate for the ACE EV and are deploying vehicles to customers. They are also seeing traction in the retail segments, but there are concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, and financing. They aim to address these issues and expect retail of ACE EV to grow month over month. They are also developing multiple variants of ACE EV to meet different requirements. For PLI, they have certificates but are still awaiting the monies. JLR's order book rundown of 5000 per month is expected to continue, and further details can be provided by Adrian.

Tata Motors has been consistently reducing their order book by about 5000 units per month for the past nine months. They plan to further reduce the order book over the next 6 months and aim to get it back to pre-pandemic levels of 110,000 units. There may be some increase in input procurement costs due to wage inflation in suppliers like IAC, but overall costs are expected to be offset by reductions in material and operational costs. The outlook for M&HCV and PV growth in FY 2025 is uncertain and will depend on various factors such as general elections and demand from fleet owners and infrastructure builders. It is too early to make predictions. The demand for PV is expected to remain strong but with single-digit growth in FY 2025. The charging behavior of EV customers shows that more than 90% of them charge their cars at home, while public chargers are primarily used on highways. Tata Motors plans to wind down the production of current Jaguar cars before launching the new fully electric Jaguar model.

Tata Motors is launching a new all-electric Jaguar, which is expected to be profitable and part of their growth plan. Gunjan from Bank of America asks about the outlook for electric vehicles (EVs) in India. Shailesh Chandra responds that there has been a 107% growth in EVs in the first half, but there was a decline in the second quarter due to recent launches and volume reductions. Another factor is the removal of road tax waiver in Telangana. However, there are still opportunities for growth, as EV sales are currently concentrated in 25 cities and there will be new EV models and price points in the market.

Tata Motors plans to increase EV volumes significantly. The lack of charging infrastructure has been a hurdle for EV growth, but public charging will increase in the next two years. Oil marketing companies will install 22,000 chargers on highways by 2024, providing a tailwind for EVs. Sharing the platform with JLR for the AVINYA range of products is significant for Tata Motors. It allows access to state-of-the-art features and cost synergies. The JLR platform improves reliability, predictability, and future readiness. Working together also reduces time and delivers a premium electric SUV.

Adrian agrees with the collaboration between JLR and the Tata group. Richard confirms the 10% EBIT margin guidance for FY 2026. Girish explains the M&HCV market share gain is due to improving the value proposition and service offerings. Shailesh reports strong growth in festive sales and a positive response to the new Nexon.

Tata Motors Limited had improved EV margins for the quarter. Four key factors contributed to this improvement: reduction in cell costs, reduction in non-cell costs, use of new generation and compact aggregates, and a cost reduction program. Price hikes were announced in October, and the company will gradually pass on the increase during the quarter. The commodity environment, particularly steel, may pose some challenges. There may be a slowdown in global markets, but the impact on EV penetration remains uncertain.

There is a slowdown in the market. Discounting is happening because there is an oversupply compared to natural demand. Interest rates are high, but we are not affected by it. We have a strong position in the market and a lot of pent-up demand. We can increase incentives and be competitive in the market. We are cautious about the difficulties in the market and plan to stay ahead. In the PV business, there have been some production constraints in the last two months. We had the highest production month last month but lost some opportunities due to ramping up new models. Curvv and Sierra will be launched in 2024 and 2025 respectively. The Sanand plant will start production in the first half of 2024.

P.B. Balaji asked about the transaction valuation, burn rate, and funding needed for Freight Tiger in the next few years. The transaction valuation is approximately Rs. 420 crores. They estimate a cash burn of around Rs. 100 crores in the next two to three years. The business is well funded. Shailesh Chandra explained that some competition had seen a decrease in order books due to the festive season, but the new launches balanced it out. They expect strong PV volume run rates in the second half. They are waiting for the Auto PLI cash to come through. JLR's working capital cycle is expected to reverse in the next six months. They have plans to set up battery plants in the UK and India. There are currently no plans for fundraising for the EV arm, as they are well funded. The PLI benefit is restricted to specific Capex spending.

Tata Motors did not include the Nexon in the approval process because it was just launched. The DVA requirement needs to be met for eligibility in the PLI. EV sales need to be authorized by a statutory auditor for certification from IFC. Supplier claims will be offset. The Sanand plant costs are already in the P&L and volumes are increasing. The absence of a secondhand EV market is not the biggest impediment to EV growth, but it is important. The market for EVs will be assessed once there is a sufficient supply.

Tata Motors wants to sell cars in a used car market with lower prices and lower costs. They will transfer the warranty to the next buyer. The cars have only been available for three years. P.B. Balaji is finished answering questions and thanks everyone. He is open to more questions offline. Contact the investor relations team. Thank you for attending.
