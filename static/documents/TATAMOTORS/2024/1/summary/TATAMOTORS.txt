Tata Motors held a Q1 FY24 earnings call with several executives present.
They started with a presentation on a corporate action involving cancellation and issuance of shares.
Participant lines were in listen-only mode and questions were accepted through the teams platform.
P.B. Balaji, the Group CFO, thanked everyone for joining and mentioned the challenges they faced regarding the corporate action.
Dhiman Gupta, Head Treasury, then discussed the details of the transaction, including the cancellation of A ordinary shares and the issuance of ordinary shares.
The transaction was valued at a premium and would lead to a reduction in the capital base, making it EPS accretive.
The process would take 12 to 15 months for completion and simplify Tata Motors' share capital.
They would only have ordinary shares listed on NSE and BSE after the transaction.

Tata Motors had issued DVR (differential voting rights) shares in 2008, but most companies who issued such shares became defunct. Tata Motors is the only large corporate with outstanding DVR shares. In 2009, SEBI amended its regulation to disallow future issuances of such instruments. The discount on Tata Motors' "A" ordinary shares has increased over the years. Shareholders have requested actions to support the share price, but previous measures have not been effective. The proposed scheme involves a NCLT arrangement offering 0.7 ordinary shares for every "A" ordinary share. Shareholders will face capital gains tax, and there will be withholding taxes on the deemed dividends. A trust will be formed to manage the transaction, including selling shares to settle tax liabilities. Various approvals are needed, including from SEBI, stock exchanges, NCLT, and creditors. PWC and two merchant banks have provided valuation and fairness opinions for the transaction.

Tata Motors had Citibank and Axis Capital giving opinions for "A" ordinary shares and ordinary shareholders respectively. The share capital base of Tata Motors would decrease by about Rs. 15 crore and the overall capital base would have a 4.2% value accretion for all shareholders. Public shareholders' voting rights would increase by 3% and promoters' voting rights would decrease. The proposal is considered balanced and beneficial for all stakeholders. "A" ordinary shareholders would benefit from a better discount and more liquidity for their shares. Ordinary shareholders' economic rights would not be impacted but they would benefit from a 4% EPS accretion. The transaction would increase the free float of ordinary shares by 18% and enhance public shareholder voting rights by 3%. The delisting of ADRs and the capital reduction of "A" ordinary shares would consolidate trading into ordinary shares. There would be no impact on net debt targets. There will be 15 more minutes for questions and then they will proceed with the results call. The taxation impact of the transaction will result in withholding taxes for "A" ordinary shareholders and the distribution of ordinary shares will be treated as a deemed dividend.

Tata Motors will be deducting withholding taxes for non-resident shareholders. If there are gains on the shares when they are sold on the stock exchange, they will be deducted. Short-term withholding tax will also be deducted, as well as other taxes like securities tax and brokerage tax. Shareholders will receive a credit in capital gains tax for the deemed dividend. Shareholders will be issued certificates for the withholding taxes to offset their own taxes. Tata Motors will set up a trust to handle the withholding taxes. The trust will receive the shares and sell them on the stock market to recover the withholding tax liabilities. After paying the taxes, the remaining shares and any extra cash will be issued to the shareholders. The trust will be set up before the effective date once the necessary approvals are received. There are questions about the cancellation of "A" ordinary shares and how the number of shares issued will differ based on tax liability for different types of investors. Tata Motors will issue the same consideration, but the trust will determine the number of shares to sell based on the tax residencies of each shareholder. The withholding tax liabilities are different for domestic shareholders, mutual funds, insurance companies, FPIs, and NRIs.

Tata Motors Limited will issue new shares, and shareholders will receive different amounts due to withheld taxes. The process will take about 12 to 15 months. The share price changes will not affect the fixed consideration. The valuation was determined by considering economic equality and market factors, resulting in a 30% discount.

Tata Motors discussed the issue price for the trust, but it is not relevant because they will issue new shares. The record date is being fixed now. They plan to submit the schemes to NCLT in the next 15 days. The company will provide updates as the process progresses. They will now move on to the results presentation. There is an accounting policy change impacting JLR IFRS numbers. Several actions were taken, including the BS6 Phase 2 transition and the launch of the Agratas. The company is happy with the strong set of numbers for the quarter. The revenue grew by 42%, with 30% coming from volume and mix and 8% from price. Both JLR and commercial vehicles showed profitability. Net debt continues to reduce. The next presenter is Richard, but it is unclear if he is available.

During the meeting, Richard Molyneux mentioned the Range Rover Sport SV, Edition One which has over 2,000 reservations. The revenue was GBP 6.9 billion, slightly down due to lower volume and foreign exchange impact. The EBIT and EBITDA were the highest in six and eight years respectively. One item affecting the EBIT was non-cash related. Free cash flow improved by GBP 1.2 billion. The order book remains strong with 185,000 units, mainly consisting of Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender. Net debt decreased to just below GBP 2.5 billion with GBP 4.0 billion of cash available. Wholesales were 1% lower, retails remained the same, and Defender consistently sold over 100,000 vehicles annually. Defender also won an award for its high residual value, indicating brand strength.

Tata Motors is confident that they can generate success by reimagining the Jaguar brand. Current sales for Discovery and Jaguar are flat. China and the JV are performing well, while the UK and Europe face supply shortages. PHEV vehicles, especially the Range Rover with a pure electric range of over 100 kilometers, are in high demand. Profit before tax has improved from a loss of GBP524 million to a favourable amount of GBP435 million. Volume and mix are driving profitability, with Range Rover and other models seeing increased sales. The P&A business is strong, benefiting from increased volume and a young car park. Pricing remains positive, but there are inflationary pressures on costs. Tata Motors is investing in fixed marketing to generate demand in the future. Administrative costs are focused on their transformation efforts.

Tata Motors had a strong quarter with a profit before tax of GBP435 million. Cash profit after tax reached GBP323 million, the highest recorded. Free cash flow was GBP450 million, unaffected by working capital. Investment totaled GBP697 million, with GBP174 million allocated to capital. Engineering capitalization rate increased to 61%. Wholesale volume slightly decreased due to supply constraints, but chip shortages are expected to improve gradually. Additional efforts are being made to manage the supply base more effectively. Q2 production is projected to be lower than Q1 due to a two-week shutdown in August. The production rate of Range Rover and Range Rover Sport is steadily increasing and will further expand with the installation of a second body shop. This will allow for over 3,000 units per week production.

Tata Motors has a strong order bank but it's too high, causing delays for customers. They have invested in their products, such as the new Range Rover Evoque with updated exterior and technology, and the Discovery Sport with significant changes to the interior. They are honored to have the Chairman and Rishi visit and invest in the UK factory. They believe being part of the Tata ecosystem allows them to access synergies and they remain optimistic for the rest of the year. However, Q2 may be worse in terms of production and cash flow. They will revisit their guidance after Q2 and may revise their P&L guidance upwards. Their priorities are to focus on supply availability, drive their brands and vehicles, and execute their plans flawlessly. In commercial vehicles, the availability of BS6 Phase 2 vehicles impacted their performance but it started improving in June. They aim to grow competitively and profitably this year.

Tata Motors reported a 15% decline in wholesales and a 14% decline in retails, which was expected due to the BS6 Phase 2 migration buildup. However, despite the decline in wholesales, revenue increased by 4% and PBT before exceptional items was positive. EBITDA and EBIT margins also improved. Girish Wagh highlighted that wholesale volume remained flat or slightly reduced, but registration volumes declined by around 6%. There was growth in both EBITDA and EBIT margins due to realization improvement and cost reduction. The non-vehicle business revenue grew by 25%. The sentiment index for trucks and tippers increased, and there was growth in M&HCVs and passenger carriers. The passenger market has returned to pre-COVID levels.

Tata Motors has seen an increase in digital lead generation and conversion, resulting in 16% of sales being generated from digital channels. They have migrated their entire product range into BS6 Phase 2, which has led to improvements in performance, cost of ownership, and connectivity. The company received positive testimonials from over 250 influencers testing their vehicles. Field trials of the BS6 Phase 2 vehicles have shown good performance improvement and customer acceptance. Tata Motors plans to focus on realization improvement and retail growth in Q2 to drive Vahan share recovery. They also aim to establish product and brand superiority in micro segments and markets for BS6 Phase 2. The company will scale up EV supplies for ACE electric vehicles and electric buses. They have seen growth in spares and service penetration and are working on maintaining market shares and improving margins in international markets. In terms of electric mobility, Tata Motors has deployed over 600 buses and sold 600 electric vehicles in the first quarter. They have set up EV support centers and are expanding availability of ACE-EVs in more cities. Additionally, Tata Motors has formed a subsidiary to develop and manufacture low and zero emission powertrains in partnership with Cummins. In the smart city mobility sector, the DTC CESL operations have deployed over 200 buses with consistent availability. The digital business, Fleet Edge, has over 450,000 vehicles on the platform and has introduced subscription models that have been well received. E-Dukaan, their online marketplace, has grown by 250% in Q1.

Tata Motors had a successful year with the CV business growing rapidly. In the PV segment, the domestic market share increased to 14.2%, and EV penetration and CNG also improved. The EV side achieved 19,000 units in the quarter and is on track for 100,000 units for the full year. The financials showed growth in volumes and revenue, but EBITDA declined due to higher operating leverage. However, the PV business maintained a good EBITDA performance. The EV business faced challenges with the IPL ending and high lithium prices, but with PLI filing and ARAI certificates received, the second half of the year is expected to see improvement. Overall, the business is confident about their EBITDA numbers. The company is seeing positive trends in volume, mix realization, and variable cost. Various investments and strategies are being implemented to drive further growth.

Tata Motors had a strong Q1 with 9% wholesale growth and a 2.5x increase in EV sales. The SUV segment saw multiple launches, leading to a 6% increase in market share. Tata Motors is the number three player in the PV and EV market with a 14.2% market share. They maintained their position as number one in the compact SUV segment and number two in the high SUV segment. Tata Motors also gained the number two position in hatches. They doubled their EV volumes and have a strong booking pipeline. The industry has a strong booking pipeline and EV adoption is growing beyond the top 20 cities. Demand is expected to increase in the South and West during the festive season. Challenges include the high growth rates of the previous year and upcoming new launches in the industry. Tata Motors will focus on retail momentum and marketing actions for hatches, Tiago, and Altroz.

Tata Motors has been growing and gaining market share despite pressure on the hatch segment. They are focused on reducing costs and improving margins. They expect to benefit from EVs, new generation aggregates, and localization activities. In terms of financials, there was a cash outflow of Rs. 2,000 crores due to working capital, but this is seasonal and will reverse going forward. They are on track with their Capex plans of Rs. 8,000 crores. Tata Motors Finance is back to profitability, with reducing GNPA and a focus on portfolio quality. The demerger of the NBFC business has been completed. Credit ratings are improving, and they expect optimistic demand and moderate inflation. They aim to sustain strong performance throughout the year by executing their priorities flawlessly.

During the July 25, 2023 Questions and Answers session of Tata Motors Limited:
- Richard Molyneux addressed the decline in depreciation expense, stating that it is due to the wind-out of a previous impairment.
- Adrian Mardell mentioned that the demand has been steady overall, with the base falling as expected.
- P. B. Balaji asked Shailesh Chandra about the sharp decline in EV segment profitability, which was attributed to the increase in cell prices and front-loading of fixed marketing expenses due to IPL.
- Shailesh Chandra added that the EV segment will see margin benefits in the future due to a recovery in numbers and cost reductions through localization and generation two aggregates.
- P. B. Balaji then mentioned that there are questions regarding demand and market shares, and asked Girish about plans to restore market shares and the balance between profitability and market shares.

In the second quarter, Tata Motors expects demand to be higher than last year, with growth varying between 5% to 10% depending on the segment. The ILMCV segment will have the least growth, while the passenger segment will have the maximum growth. The HCV segment is expected to grow in double-digits. July is traditionally a low month due to the rains, but demand is expected to pick up once the rains subside. Tata Motors aims to grow profitably and regain market share through delivering value with superior products. They have upgraded their entire range to improve cost of ownership and value for the customer. They will focus on communicating this value through various marketing activities, including influencers, BTL activation, and trials. They are also leveraging Fleet Edge insights and their Sampoorna Seva Service package to provide better benefit and peace of mind to customers. The goal is to deliver more value to customers and increase realization. There are some questions about volumes for the quarter and achieving the yearly target of 400,000 plus units, as well as inquiries about margins and future plans for EBIT margins.

Tata Motors is comfortable with a yearly target of 400,000 units. They are currently building up inventory to sell higher volumes in the second half of the year. A second body shop will also be operational for Range Rover vehicles. The manufacturing of additional units has caused manufacturing costs to be absorbed onto the balance sheet. The reported EBIT has decreased to around 7.5%. The guidance will be reviewed in three months and may be revised upwards. In China, Tata Motors expects to sell more units this fiscal year compared to the previous year. The demand for Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender in China is strong. Order banks in China are not built up like in other regions, but they do feed stock into the marketplace. The order bank for China is currently over 10,000 units. The demand in other parts of the world is developing positively.

Tata Motors sees increased demand in the second half of the year, especially for their big three products in North America, Middle East, and China. Their marketing costs for these products are low. If demand starts to decline, they have the ability to stimulate more orders through marketing. 

Regarding costs, the reduction in precious metals and base metals is expected to lower RM costs in Q2. Steel prices are expected to go back to Q4 levels, which will be beneficial. Additionally, there is a reduction in battery prices for electric vehicles.

Tata Motors has filed an application for PLI and expects to receive the benefits in the second half of the year. Pricing actions will depend on the competitive landscape.

Richard will provide insight on the decline in raw materials for the second half of the year.

Tata Motors is seeing some favorable changes in metals, specifically Aluminum. They expect these changes to flow through to the second half of the year. The dynamic in the second half will involve slightly lower material costs and slightly increasing VME, which will offset within margins. There is no cash outflow or investment being made by Tata Motors or JLR in the Agratas battery plant. R&D capitalization varies but is expected to stay around 50-60% for the next few quarters. JLR aims to be successful in the EV market, particularly in China where the industry is focused on lower-priced BEV and PHEV models. Traditional luxury car manufacturers are currently selling stronger in traditional ICE vehicles than in BEV.

Tata Motors has not seen significant success with the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) yet. They plan to launch their first EV, MLA, later this year and in China in 2025. They will continue offering internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electrify those as well. They believe that the transition from ICE to EV will happen over time if they offer high-quality luxury products. They are confident in their product plan and timeline. There is a backlog of orders for both EVs and ICE vehicles, with waiting periods ranging from 3 to 12 weeks. The industry is facing demand pressure in the entry segment, but SUVs are performing well. Tata Motors has been able to control their vehicle manufacturing expense (VME). They may increase marketing costs in the future. High inflation and a stronger GBP in the UK do not concern them in terms of cost competitiveness for JLR.

Tata Motors sees an opportunity to increase demand and offset marketing costs with cost reductions in three areas: material costs, manufacturing efficiencies, and supply costs. They also expect improvements in product quality and warranty costs. The outlook for EV margins is strong due to factors such as recovering cell prices, the addition of PLI, localization efforts, and lower-cost new generation aggregates. Tata Motors is expanding its network in smaller cities through a shop-in-shop concept and plans to separate ICE and EV showrooms in cities with high volumes.

Tata Motors is working on building service capability and training for service engineers. The order book has decreased from 200K to 185K, but the percentage of Range Rover Sports and Defender remains constant at 76%. Other vehicle orders have dropped over the past year. Range Rover has the highest loyalty rates. The effective tax rate for JLR is 26% with a deferred tax asset. There are no obstacles to changing or increasing guidance, but more clarity is needed before making any decisions. Delivery plans and strategy remain the same.

They have executed the plan and will talk about the numbers later. Girish has fully transitioned the portfolio to BS6 Phase 2 with added enhancements. They aim to increase value and regain market shares. Balaji has questions regarding the one-off 110 bps and inventory costs. Richard explains the timing impact of stock buildup. There are questions about the company's high levels of cash and plans to become net debt free. They will continue working on the best way to handle the cash. There is also a question about achieving net debt free status earlier based on future cash flow generation.

Tata Motors Limited is waiting for more quarters before confirming anything. They have just started the year. There are no new questions, except for one about Tata Technologies IPO timing. They have got approval from SEBI and will inform at the right time. There are no more questions or messages. They thank everyone for their questions and support and look forward to speaking again.
