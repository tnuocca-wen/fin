Tata Motors had a strong quarter with improvement in commercial vehicles. Overall volumes and revenues increased, with a double-digit EBITDA. The business is on track with market share and profitability improving. The source of profitability came from volume, mix, realizations, and savings. Consumer-facing metrics, such as brand power and dealer satisfaction, are also positive. Girish Wagh highlighted the industry's growth in volumes and the launch of new products. The non-vehicle business and spares and service penetration have been steadily improving. EBIT is now at its highest in 21 quarters, attributed to discount reduction, cost reduction, and commodities softening. The industry saw significant growth compared to the previous year.

Tata Motors had a good year in the medium and heavy commercial vehicles sector, with a 52% growth. The passenger segment, especially buses, also saw growth. The company's focus on improving brand health through communication and influencer advocacy led to a higher net promoter score and brand power. Tata Motors has transitioned its entire portfolio to BS6 Phase II and improved total cost of ownership, comfort, convenience, connectivity, and safety features in their products. The new pricing guideline for CNG will bring certainty to customers and increase CNG penetration. Tata Motors will continue to focus on retail and registration shares, and communicate the value enhancements of their products to customers. They will also scale up EV supplies and focus on downstream business growth.

Tata Motors had a positive financial report, discussing EV financials and intercompany consolidation. The business is making an EBITDA loss of Rs. 350 crores, primarily due to product development costs. However, the EV business is on the right track for sustainable profitability. Structural fixed costs are increasing due to investments in the EV business. The industry saw record growth in FY23, with SUVs and EVs increasing in popularity. Tata Motors had its highest-ever wholesale year, with 5.4 lakh volumes and a market share of 13.5%. EV sales crossed 50,000, including international sales.

Tata Motors has introduced an innovative concept of CNG space. They are focusing on mid-cycle enhancements for some products. They are the only player in certain segments, which will help improve sales in the diesel segment.

They are now moving on to the Q&A session where they will address questions about EV financials, subsidiary companies, government grants, and headwinds and tailwinds in the industry. There are also tailwinds in the ICE segment from new launches and refreshes.

Tata Motors Limited had a strong industry demand and no drop in demand. However, the entry segment is under pressure due to high interest rates. The EV industry is growing with more launches and increasing consumer acceptance. Sales of EVs have increased to 8,500 to 9,000 per month. The environment is favorable for EVs with progressive policies. Next year, Tata Motors expects volumes to be around 400,000. Supplier inflation is expected to reduce, but foreign exchange rates are less favorable. Marketing investments are needed to secure order intake. Vehicle manufacturing expenses (VME) are expected to increase gradually. Goldman has questions about EBIT margin and cash flow. Tata Motors is confident in improved performance. The order bank is at 200,000, but new order numbers seem lower. JLR rebranding is not just a corporate action, there are ground-level reasons behind it.

In the past year, Tata Motors has faced challenges with supply and breakeven, but in the third and fourth quarters, they saw improvement. They expect this trend to continue into FY'24. The order bank is still too high and they anticipate it will gradually decrease. The most popular vehicles are the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender. Each brand under Land Rover has distinct characteristics that they aim to focus on to attract customers.

During the meeting, Jemma from J.P. Morgan asked about the free cash flow guidance and net debt reduction for next year, specifically how much is due to working capital and underlying cash flows. Richard clarified that despite increasing Capex to GBP 3 billion, they anticipate generating over GBP 2 billion in cash to reduce net debt from GBP 3 billion to GBP 1 billion. The majority of cash generation will be operational in the first half of the year, with more working capital in the second half. Richard emphasized their strong cash generation and breakeven volume of 300,000 units. Ben mentioned the possibility of returning to the bond market, but there is no immediate need as they expect positive cash flow after significant investment spending. Lastly, Rakesh from BNP Paribas inquired about JLR's investment of GBP 15 billion, asking about the allocation for R&D in EV and ICE products.

Tata Motors' total engineering expenses increased by GBP 400 million to GBP 1.69 billion. They expect the increase to continue next year, with most of it going towards capital for industrialization of car lines. They will invest in ICE to meet Euro 7 regulations, but their focus is mostly on EVs. They will defend their volume and market share in the domestic PV market by expanding the SUV segment and introducing new models. They will also bring CNG and EV variants, and add new nameplates like Curvv and Sierra.

In May 12, 2023, Tata Motors discussed margin improvement drivers and why their margins are not as strong as others in the market. They mentioned that EBIT has increased by 300bps, showing an improving trend. EV business is also growing rapidly, but there are product development expenses affecting the margins. However, they have plans to strengthen EV margins through factors like decreasing battery prices and semiconductor purchases. They are also focusing on localization to reduce costs. Additionally, new models in higher SUV segments will have better margins. On the PV side, they expect a richer mix of products and have a cost reduction plan in place. They aim to reach a 10% EBITDA margin in PV. Despite industry growth, industry volumes are still below the previous peak. But the upcoming general elections and increased government spending on infrastructure are expected to support industry growth. Although the growth rate may vary across segments, buses might see the highest growth.

Tata Motors' buses are at a lower level, but there is good growth in medium and heavy commercials. ILCVs may remain flat compared to last year, while small commercial vehicles may grow slightly. Q1 may see a decrease in YoY growth due to pre-buy effect and transition into BS6 Phase II and price increase. However, growth is expected in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Overall, industry volume is expected to have single-digit growth. On the PV side, industry growth will remain intact due to underlying drivers and upgrade customers. Growth this year will be moderate at 5% to 7%, but will return to double-digit growth beyond this financial year. Discussions with the Ministry of heavy industries on PLI have been positive, and Tata Motors is confident of availing the PLI benefit. April volumes for Tata Motors were weaker than the industry, but growth is expected to return. Trucking conditions and dealer inventories are trending well.

During the meeting, Girish Wagh discussed the drop in retail volumes in April due to the pre-buy effect in March. He also mentioned significant improvements in the product portfolio and supply chain issues in April that will be resolved in May. Wagh expects a decline in retail registration volumes in Q1 but growth to resume in Q2. The trucking sentiment index has gone up for tippers but dipped slightly for other segments. Dealer inventories remain healthy. In response to a question about EV buses, Wagh stated that even without FAME subsidies, electric buses are viable as they are mainly consumed by the government in an Opex model. Private customers are also showing interest in electric buses. Regarding participation in MSRTC orders, Tata Motors stayed away from the recent CESL tender due to the absence of a payment security mechanism.

Tata Motors will re-bid a tender and work with the government for a payment security mechanism. PB Balaji will address Jinesh's questions offline. Joseph's questions about order flow and working capital have been covered. Activation of the Sanand plant will bring some cost without revenue, but it's part of long-term planning. Conversations are underway for battery plants in India and Europe. India's free cash flow will contribute to reducing net debt. Adrian is not concerned about competition's price cuts for Jaguar. JLR's dividend policy will be reviewed by the board at the appropriate time.

Tata Motors had a meeting on May 12, 2023. Chirag asked about the volumes and if it would lead to adverse mix. Richard said no. He mentioned an order bank of 200,000, with 76% being Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender. Commodity benefits are expected to flow in as inflationary pressures at suppliers decrease. There may be upsides and downsides in supply costs, but outbound inflation is expected to exceed inbound inflation. Girish discussed the discount pullback and how it is based on customer value perception. They have been focusing on increasing customer value and communicating it. There was a transition during product development to increase market operating prices. PV outlook has changed significantly and Shailesh has covered the industry scenario. No clarification on battery Capex for Tata Motors.
