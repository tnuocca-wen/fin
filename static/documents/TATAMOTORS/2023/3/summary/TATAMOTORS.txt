BSE Limited, located in Mumbai, sent a letter to the National Stock Exchange of India regarding the transcript of a Q3 FY2023 earnings discussion/conference call. The transcript is available on the Tata Motors website. Tata Motors Limited hosted the conference call, which included various management members such as P.B. Balaji, Girish Wagh, Shailesh Chandra, Adrian Mardell, and Richard Molyneux. The call focused on the earnings presentation and included a Q&A session. The quarter was intense, with highlights including the Auto Expo and the acquisition of the Ford facility in Sanand. There was also a drawdown notice for a substantial amount of funds and discussions about JLR's order book and the semiconductor situation.

Tata Motors had a satisfying performance in the quarter with a revenue of Rs. 88,500 crores, EBITDA of 11.1%, and profit before tax and exceptional items of Rs. 3,200 crores. The three auto verticals are profitable and improving. Volume, mix, and pricing contributed to growth. Automotive debt decreased to Rs. 57,500 crores. JLR may not meet net debt zero targets. Adrian will discuss JLR's presentation. Retails were slightly lower but MLA unit deliveries improved. Revenue increased by 5.7% with strong PBT and EBIT. Cash reserves are strong at GBP 3.9 billion.

In January, Tata Motors extended their credit facility to GBP 1.52 billion until April 2026. Retail volumes fell, but deliveries on the Defender nameplate improved. Wholesale volumes have also seen a steady increase. Range Rover and Range Rover Sport deliveries have improved, especially in North America. Deliveries in China were affected by lockdowns but are now expected to increase. The number of electrified units has grown to 67%. The profitability has been influenced by volume and mix. Material cost inflation and utility prices have been challenging, but prices and VME are expected to offset these costs in the future. Tata Motors is investing more in marketing and engineering for their electrified future.

Tata Motors had a strong quarter with a 3.7% EBIT and a profit after tax of GBP 800 million. The company expects their cash flow to improve and working capital to increase as production and wholesale volumes grow. They achieved a GBP 490 million free cash flow, the best in seven quarters. The company plans to invest more in engineering and their Reimagine electrified strategy. They anticipate their investment to reach GBP 700 million in the next quarter or two. The MLA architecture, represented by the Range Rover Sport, is a key highlight in their electrified strategy. They plan to have a full electrified Bev Range Rover within two years.

Tata Motors plans to introduce its first all new electrified Jaguar products in 2025, followed by other Range Rover and Defender products within the next two years. They expect most vehicles to be fully electrified within two years and complete the transition for all models before the end of the decade. They estimate that 60% of sales will be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) by then. They aim to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036 and net zero carbon emissions by the end of the decade. Investments towards their electrified future will be made in the next 12 to 18 months.

As for wholesale volumes, quarter-over-quarter improvements show about a 15% increase in Q2 '23 compared to Q2 '22. They anticipate further growth in Q4 and beyond. Although there are challenges, such as COVID in China, Tata Motors is stabilizing break-even points, leading to increased profitability, EBIT, revenue, and cash.

The MLA architecture of Range Rover and Range Rover Sport is crucial to their business model. After overcoming difficulties in gaining parts, they have seen growth in average weekly productions. They expect a sizeable 10% to 15% improvement in Q4 compared to Q3, maintaining a delivery percentage of 33% to 35% and average selling prices. Their business results have started to reflect this progress.

Regarding order banks, new orders are expected to grow by approximately 30,000 per month. Fulfilled orders (retails) are already increasing in Q4, primarily due to the reopening of China. They anticipate fulfilled orders to surpass new orders in Q4, leading to a tapering down of order banks over the next few months to a more natural level of around 200,000. This trend is expected for the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender. A third shift on Defender production will contribute to the growth in fulfilled orders. Additionally, they expect to build 10% to 15% more of the other two models.

Tata Motors saw industry growth of 16% in Q3 FY22, but the growth rate is expected to decrease in Q4. Retail sales were ahead of wholesales by 6% as the company prepares for the RDE transition in April. Commodity prices have softened, especially steel and precious metals. CNG volumes have come down, as well as the share in the portfolio. Medium and heavy commercial vehicles and the passenger segment have seen good growth. The spare parts and consumables business has grown by 38% compared to last year. The company has launched 40 new products and 150 variants, including the Ace Electric vehicle and new range of pickups. The focus moving forward will be on retail pull, improving registration share, and realization improvement. The company is engaging with stakeholders in the ecosystem and preparing for the RDE transition. The semiconductor supply situation has improved, and the company is monitoring electric vehicle aggregates. In international markets, volumes have decreased significantly, but Tata Motors aims to maintain market shares. Selling margins and channel health have been doing well even at lower volumes.

Tata Motors completed successful trials of Ace Electric Vehicle. The product received positive feedback and generated more inquiries. They have started deliveries and are ramping up production. They showcased eight zero emission concepts in Auto Expo. Tata Motors signed agreements for buses with Delhi Transport Corporation, Bangalore, and Jammu & Srinagar. Their e-bus fleet has traveled more than 60 million kilometers with good uptime. The digital businesses, including the connected truck platform and E-Dukaan, are seeing growth. Sales generated through digital leads accounted for 16% of the total. Tata Motors demonstrated 14 concepts at Auto Expo to show their commitment towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. They introduced new electric and fuel agnostic architectures. They also revealed new CNG and LNG vehicles. The exhibits on fleet edge, connected truck platform, and E-Dukaan attracted attention. Overall, it was a comprehensive display of Tata Motors' capabilities.

Tata Motors is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions and developing cutting-edge products and services. In the passenger vehicles segment, market share and growth have improved consistently, with CNG and EV vehicles comprising about 17% of the portfolio. The company has sold over 50,000 EV vehicles and continues to see strong profitability with 37% revenue growth and steady improvement. Realizations and variable costs are improving, while investments in the EV business and products have reduced fixed costs. The industry has witnessed record retail and wholesale sales, with Tata Motors maintaining a 14% market share. The PV and EV business achieved industry-beating growth of 33% and set a record for quarterly retail sales. In 2022, Tata Motors crossed the five-lakh mark in sales and sold around 44,000 EVs.

Tata Motors SUVs Nexon and Punch are among the top three in the market. EV sales for the financial year are at 32.4K units with a market share of 85%. Quarter four is expected to be strong in wholesale and EV growth due to new product launches and progressive EV policies. Tiago EV deliveries have started with a strong order book. The Harrier & Safari Red # Dark will be launched this quarter. BSVI phase two transition is on track. Ford plant acquisition is completed. Supply has normalized, except for some popular models with high waiting lists. Increased enquiry time may impact demand. Demand generation initiatives will be implemented. Structural cost reduction actions will be taken for margin improvement. In the Auto Expo, Tiago EV, Harrier EV, Sierra EV, and Avinya were showcased. Harrier & Safari #Dark with ADAS and a bigger infotainment screen will be launched this quarter. CNG twin cylinder technology was shown to maximize boot space. The ICE version of Curvv was also showcased with TGDi engines.

Tata Motors had strong cash flow after tax, adequately funding capex and recovering working capital. Investment spending for the year remains unchanged. Tata Motors Finance had disappointments due to poor performance in the restructured book and one-time hit due to RBI upgradation norms. Efforts are being made to normalize the restructured book and early results are encouraging. Collection efforts need to be focused on the restructured book. Priorities remain cautiously optimistic about demand in JLR and India. Chip supplies are expected to improve, leading to steady volume ramp-up. Stable commodity prices and focus on profitable growth should result in strong EBIT and free cash flows in Q4.

The terms of the extension of the revolver are similar to the previous one with a 50 basis point increase in the interest rate. The undrawn portion of the revolver incurs a 35% margin. The annual cost of the revolver is estimated to be GBP18 million. The company does not plan to change the size of the revolver as it is considered low-cost liquidity insurance. The demand outlook for JLR is expected to remain high even after clearing the order backlog. The challenge for the company is more about supply rather than demand, given the current uncertainties in the marketplace. The company has opportunities to increase demand through marketing efforts.

The discussion is about Tata Motors considering price hikes due to stricter emission standards in FY 24. The cost increases for RDE will be less than BSVI Phase 1, but commodity increases may happen in Q1 of the next financial year. The price increase will depend on these factors and will vary model by model. In the LCV segment, there is a decline in the ILCV category, while MHCV is showing growth due to higher freight availability. The decline in ILCV is attributed to the base effect and the resurgence of CNG vehicles. Overall, ILCV is expected to grow 14-15% while small vehicles are expected to grow more than 20% for the entire fiscal year. In terms of JLR, higher inflation and supplier claims are related to constrained volumes. The quantum of these issues and the expected moderation of chip-related cost inflation are uncertain.

Tata Motors talked about increased SG&A spend. They want to increase it to targeted levels. There are three distinct questions. Adrian answered them in order. They expect the normal level for wholesale units to be 120,000 units per quarter, 40,000 units per month, and 500,000 units per year. They need to reach 40,000 units per month to be considered normal. They are currently above 26,000-27,000 units per month. They believe they will move towards the normal level in 2023. Once they reach that level, some reasons for claims will be eliminated. Commodity prices will still be a problem. They will increase SG&A spend in line with revenue improvements. It is currently 9% of revenue. PHEV incentives coming down in Europe may pose a risk to JLR's compliance with CAFE targets. The outlook for FCF breakeven in FY 23 is conservative. Tata's battery manufacturing plants in Europe will be discussed separately.

Adrian Mardell stated that PHEV volumes have been consistent at around 11% for several quarters. The current order bank shows PHEV orders at 14%, indicating no significant impact from customer incentive changes. JLR expects strong cash flow in Q4 similar to Q3, with increased volume and increased investments. Working capital in Q4 is expected to be lower than Q3 due to lower build units. The total cash for the year is expected to be slightly lower in Q4. PB Balaji mentioned that Tata is investing in battery plants in Europe for Tata Sons entity with JLR and Tata Motors as anchor customers. No further details about the locations were provided. Shailesh Chandra explained that the price cut in the Nexon variant of EV was based on holistic consideration, including future growth aspiration, cost reductions, PLI benefits, and competitive landscape. The Nexon brand has a strong referral and value proposition with improved range.

Tata Motors decided to delist ADRs due to cost of compliance, pressure on shares, and lack of relevance. The Indian market is deep and wide, making it unnecessary to list ADRs for fundraising. Compliances are getting more complicated, so delisting was a simplification move. Tata Technologies listing will help with auto debt deleveraging. Discounting trends in the CV industry have been reduced, with transparency in systems. Tiago EV order book has crossed 20,000 and deliveries have started. The target is to keep waiting periods within six months. VME trend in JLR is being studied, considering macro factors and pricing from EV OEMs.

Tata Motors is not experiencing any improvements in VME. Demand and orders are surpassing supply. Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender are the main contributors to the data. VME is currently at 0% with low order intake and production instability. There may be an increase in the future. PLI scheme benefits for the EV, PV subsidiary will be obtained after filing for them. Current capacity is around 50,000 per month with the possibility of increasing by 10% to 15%. The Ford plant will be operational in 12 to 18 months. Other expenses have decreased due to cost phasing. New products showcased in the Auto Expo will be available in two to three years, with the Harrier EV coming in 2024.

Tata Motors introduced three electric vehicle products, with Tiago already launched. Curvv and the CNG models (Punch and Altroz) are scheduled for release in 2024 and the first half of next financial year, respectively. PB Balaji confirmed plans to use cash to repay maturities and mentioned an agreement to extend a loan. Shailesh Chandra stated that 25-30% of Tiago EV buyers are first-time buyers. PB Balaji mentioned that the gross margin may be dilutive initially but will improve over time. Girish Wagh discussed sentiment index changes in different vehicle categories. In terms of fuel mix changes, CNG and LNG are expected to see increased penetration, with EVs gaining more traction in buses and small commercial vehicles.

Shailesh Chandra believes that by the end of the decade, the fuel mix will be around 25-30% CNG, 25-30% EV, and the rest will be gasoline with a high mix of flex-fuel. Diesel will significantly decrease below 5%. There is no risk to ICE pricing for entry level cars due to price cuts in EVs in China and other regions. Adrian Mardell doesn't see any evidence of weakening prices for imported units in China. There may be short-term pressure on EV profitability due to temporary volatilities in battery prices, but in the mid-term, it will be beneficial due to scale and deeper localization.
